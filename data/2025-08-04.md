### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QME is a novel framework for whole-body biometric recognition, using a learnable score-fusion strategy with Mixture of Experts (MoE) to improve performance by addressing score distribution variations and data quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of unimodal systems and improving performance by addressing overlooked variations in score distributions of individual modalities.

Method: Introduces QME with a pseudo-quality loss for quality estimation and a score triplet loss for metric improvement, leveraging MoE for learnable score-fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, outperforming baseline methods in various metrics.

Conclusion: QME effectively addresses challenges like model misalignment and data quality variability, proving robust for multimodal and multi-model scenarios.

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores motion transferability in action recognition models, introducing a framework with three datasets to evaluate 13 models. Findings show performance drops in novel contexts, with insights on model biases and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if action recognition models can transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions, and understand their limitations.

Method: A motion transferability framework with three datasets (Syn-TA, Kinetics400-TA, Something-Something-v2-TA) is used to evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Models struggle with fine-grained unknown actions, perform worse in controlled settings, and face challenges with temporal reasoning. Larger models improve transferability for spatial cues but falter with temporal ones.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for motion transferability, highlighting model biases and the need for disentangling coarse and fine motions to improve recognition.

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taih√∫ Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monado SLAM dataset to address gaps in existing VIO/SLAM systems for head-mounted sensors, covering challenging real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIO/SLAM systems struggle with head-mounted use cases like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, and adverse conditions, lacking comprehensive datasets.

Method: The authors present the Monado SLAM dataset, a collection of real sequences from multiple VR headsets, released under a permissive license.

Result: The dataset aims to improve VIO/SLAM research by addressing overlooked real-world challenges.

Conclusion: The Monado SLAM dataset is a valuable resource for advancing tracking systems in head-mounted applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CNN model for gender classification using the periocular region, achieving high accuracy (99% and 96%) on two datasets, demonstrating its practical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is important in security and other fields, but accuracy is affected by cosmetics and disguise. The study focuses on the periocular region for reliable classification.

Method: A sophisticated CNN model is developed, tested on CVBL and (Female and Male) datasets, and compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The model achieved 99% accuracy on CVBL and 96% on (Female and Male) datasets with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN model is highly effective for gender classification using the periocular region, suitable for practical applications like security and surveillance.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) is a new metric for evaluating generative video models, focusing on internal world consistency through four sub-components: object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty. It combines these into a single score aligned with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation metrics often overlook temporal and physical coherence, focusing instead on visual fidelity or prompt alignment. WCS addresses this gap by emphasizing world consistency.

Method: WCS integrates four submetrics computed using open-source tools (trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow). A learned weighted formula combines these into a single score, trained with human preference data.

Result: WCS is validated using benchmarks like VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE, showing correlation with human evaluations and outperforming metrics like FVD, CLIPScore, and FVMD.

Conclusion: WCS provides a comprehensive, interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models on world coherence, filling gaps left by prior metrics.

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer improves Active Geo-localization (AGL) by using curiosity-driven exploration instead of distance-based rewards, enhancing robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGL methods struggle with unreliable exploration in challenging or unseen scenarios due to distance-based rewards.

Method: Proposes GeoExplorer, an AGL agent with curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards for goal-agnostic, robust exploration.

Result: GeoExplorer outperforms in four AGL benchmarks, especially in unfamiliar targets and environments.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven exploration enhances AGL robustness and generalization, proving effective in diverse settings.

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a 3D representation that includes uncertainty attributes for each point, improving robustness in 3D object detection by leveraging raw LiDAR measurement uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LiDAR sensors produce noisy or sparse point clouds in challenging scenarios (e.g., long-distance or low-albedo objects), which degrade downstream perception models. Conventional pipelines ignore raw measurement uncertainty, leading to accuracy loss.

Method: PPC augments each point with a probability attribute representing measurement uncertainty. The paper also introduces inference methods that use PPC for robust 3D object detection, acting as lightweight drop-in modules.

Result: PPC-based methods outperform baseline LiDAR and camera-LiDAR fusion models in simulations and real captures, especially for small, distant, low-albedo objects and strong ambient light.

Conclusion: PPC enhances 3D perception by incorporating uncertainty, offering a versatile and effective solution for noisy LiDAR data.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Modality Shifting (SMS) to quantify biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) toward text over images in medical tasks, revealing a strong reliance on text despite visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making requires balanced analysis of medical images and reports, but VLMs often favor text, potentially overlooking critical visual information.

Method: SMS perturbs data by swapping images or text between opposing labels to expose modality biases. Six VLMs are tested on MIMIC-CXR and FairVLMed datasets.

Result: VLMs show marked text dependency, even when visual information is complementary. Attention-based analysis confirms images are often overshadowed by text.

Conclusion: Multimodal medical models must genuinely integrate both modalities, not rely on single-modality signals, to ensure balanced decision-making.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

### [9] [Graph Lineages and Skeletal Graph Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00197)
*Eric Mjolsness,Cory B. Scott*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces structured graph lineages for hierarchical model architectures, defining skeletal algebraic operations and demonstrating applications in deep learning and multigrid methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework for hierarchical model architectures and efficient algebraic operations on growing graphs, applicable in machine learning and computational science.

Method: Defines graph lineages with exponential growth, bipartite connections, and prolongation maps. Introduces skeletal algebraic operations (e.g., cross product, box product) and unary operators (e.g., thickening, escalation) for graded graphs.

Result: Develops an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchical lineages, enabling space-efficient operations and continuum limit approximations.

Conclusion: The framework is versatile for hierarchical architectures and local algorithms, with demonstrated utility in deep neural networks and multigrid methods.

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for real personality recognition (RPR) by simulating personalized internal cognition from audio-visual behaviors, using a 2D-GNN for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RPR methods infer personality impressions as external observers, often deviating from real traits. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging internal cognition.

Method: Proposes simulating personalized cognition from audio-visual behaviors, encoding it as a 2D graph, and using a 2D-GNN for personality recognition. An end-to-end training strategy is employed.

Result: The approach efficiently simulates internal cognition and infers real personality traits, potentially improving recognition performance.

Conclusion: The novel RPR method, combining cognition simulation and 2D-GNN, offers a promising direction for accurate personality recognition.

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

### [11] [SAM-PTx: Text-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM with Parameter-Efficient, Parallel-Text Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00213)
*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx introduces a parameter-efficient method to adapt SAM using CLIP-derived text embeddings for semantic-guided segmentation, improving performance over spatial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of semantic text prompts in segmentation is underexplored compared to spatial prompts like points and boxes.

Method: A lightweight adapter, Parallel-Text, injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, modifying only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block.

Result: Incorporating fixed text embeddings improves segmentation performance on COD10K, COCO, and ADE20K datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic conditioning into SAM offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating local object positioning and using the Segment Anything Model or unsupervised methods improves Few-Shot Image Classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Few-Shot Image Classification due to image ambiguities like multiple objects or complex backgrounds.

Method: Use local positioning information of objects, the Segment Anything Model (requiring minimal input), and unsupervised foreground object extraction.

Result: Significant improvement in classification performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Local object positioning and simple annotation or unsupervised methods can enhance Few-Shot Image Classification.

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)
*Chenggang Guo,Hao Xu,XianMing Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MSF-UM, a guided depth map super-resolution model combining Mamba's state-space modeling with multi-scale U-shaped fusion, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are computationally expensive for high-resolution depth maps. MSF-UM aims to address these limitations.

Method: Integrates Mamba's state-space modeling into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by color images, combining local feature extraction with long-range dependency modeling.

Result: Reduces model parameters and improves reconstruction accuracy, validated on public datasets with strong generalization for large-scale tasks.

Conclusion: MSF-UM is an efficient and accurate solution for depth map super-resolution, leveraging multi-scale fusion and state-space modeling.

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

### [14] [PointGauss: Point Cloud-Guided Multi-Object Segmentation for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00259)
*Wentao Sun,Hanqing Xu,Quanyun Wu,Dedong Zhang,Yiping Chen,Lingfei Ma,John S. Zelek,Jonathan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointGauss introduces a real-time multi-object segmentation framework for Gaussian Splatting, improving efficiency and multi-view consistency with a point cloud-driven pipeline and GPU-accelerated rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting suffer from slow initialization and poor multi-view consistency.

Method: The framework uses a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder for fast 3D instance mask generation and a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system for consistency.

Result: Achieves 1.89 to 31.78% performance gains in multi-view mIoU while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PointGauss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the new DesktopObjects-360 dataset addresses limitations of current benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over

*Hyundong Jin,Hyung Jin Chang,Eunwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves continual learning in vision-language models by grounding visual translation on language instructions, using specialized experts and pruning to avoid interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglect of language instructions in continual learning for vision-language models, which often prioritize visual inputs over textual instructions.

Method: Introduces a mixture of visual projectors as specialized experts for visual-to-language translation, an expert recommendation strategy, and expert pruning to reduce interference.

Result: Outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating better instruction-following responses in diverse vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances visual and language inputs in continual learning, enhancing task adaptation and response quality.

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of multimodal referring segmentation, driven by advances in neural networks and transformers, and its practical importance in object perception.

perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

### [17] [Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00272)
*Wenyue Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions, revealing performance drops in existing methods and insights into robustness enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic correspondence is crucial for computer vision tasks, but its robustness in challenging scenarios is understudied.

Method: A novel benchmark dataset with 14 challenging scenarios is created, and extensive evaluations are conducted on existing methods, including large-scale vision models like DINO and Stable Diffusion.

Result: Existing methods show performance drops in adverse conditions; large-scale models improve robustness, but fine-tuning reduces it; DINO outperforms Stable Diffusion, and their fusion enhances robustness. Data augmentations are ineffective.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for task-specific robustness designs in semantic correspondence, as general methods fail in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

*Tran Viet Khoa,Do Hai Son,Mohammad Abu Alsheikh,Yibeltal F Alem,Dinh Thai Hoang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for drowsiness detection using Spatial Self-Attention and LSTM, with federated learning via Gradient Similarity Comparison, achieving 89.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents, but detecting it accurately is challenging due to decentralized and diverse facial data.

Method: Combines Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) with LSTM for feature extraction and uses Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) for federated learning. Includes a tool for automated video data processing.

Result: Achieves 89.9% detection accuracy in federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles real-world data variability and shows promise for enhancing road safety in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITAN-Guide is a training-free method for guiding Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models, addressing memory and control issues in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free guidance frameworks for diffusion models are either memory-intensive or offer sub-optimal control, limiting their use in computationally heavy tasks like T2V.

Method: Proposes TITAN-Guide, which optimizes diffusion latents without backpropagation using forward gradient descents and directional directives.

Result: Efficiently manages memory during latent optimization and enhances T2V performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide overcomes memory and control limitations, improving T2V diffusion model guidance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,

### [20] [AniMer+: Unified Pose and Shape Estimation Across Mammalia and Aves via Family-Aware Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00298)
*Jin Lyu,Liang An,Li Lin,Pujin Cheng,Yebin Liu,Xiaoying Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AniMer+ introduces a unified approach for reconstructing mammals and birds using a high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer with Mixture-of-Experts design, and synthetic datasets to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable stronger spatial intelligence and accurate animal pose/shape estimation across species, addressing limitations of previous methods and data scarcity.

Method: AniMer+ uses a family-aware ViT with MoE design, partitioning layers into taxa-specific and shared components, and generates synthetic datasets (CtrlAni3D and CtrlAVES3D) for training.

Result: Superior performance on benchmarks, including out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: AniMer+ effectively enhances real-world performance through its novel architecture and synthetic data, addressing key challenges in multi-species pose and shape estimation.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios enhances robustness in pedestrian detection models by integrating video inpainting and human motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian detection models lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous scenarios in training datasets.

Method: Identify pedestrian regions, expand bounding boxes, resize and stitch into a unified canvas, apply a binary mask, and guide editing via pose sequence control.

Result: Achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: The method is robust and versatile for multi-view pedestrian video generation, useful for data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

### [22] [Exploring Fourier Prior and Event Collaboration for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00308)
*Chunyan She,Fujun Han,Chengyu Fang,Shukai Duan,Lidan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method for low-light image enhancement using event cameras, decoupling the process into visibility restoration and structure refinement, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods underutilize modality-specific advantages, limiting performance in low-light image enhancement.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: visibility restoration using amplitude-phase entanglement in Fourier space, and structure refinement with dynamic alignment to address spatial mismatch. Contrastive loss is introduced for discriminative representation learning.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in experiments.

Conclusion: Decoupling the enhancement process and leveraging modality-specific advantages significantly improves low-light image enhancement performance.

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: Existing models struggle with the structural diversity and complexity of mathematical content in scientific literature.

Method: Built upon general vision-language models, the framework uses straightforward supervised fine-tuning and introduces the CSFormula dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and robustness across diverse styles and layouts.

Conclusion: DocTron-Formula sets a new paradigm for automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific
and general vision-language models often struggle to handle the structural
diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical
content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built
upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for
specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale
and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a

TL;DR: A generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised framework (GV-VAD) improves video anomaly detection by using synthetic videos for data augmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies limit the scalability and performance of existing video anomaly detection models.

Method: The GV-VAD framework leverages text-conditioned video generation models to create synthetic videos for training augmentation and employs a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy for efficient training.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset.

Conclusion: GV-VAD effectively addresses data scarcity in video anomaly detection by using synthetic data, enhancing model performance and generalization.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

*Sunghyun Park,Seokeon Choi,Hyoungwoo Park,Sungrack Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes personalization guidance for text-to-image diffusion models to balance target fidelity and text editability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between aligning with target concepts and preserving original model knowledge in few-image fine-tuning scenarios.

Method: Uses an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt and dynamically controls unlearning via weight interpolation during inference.

Result: Improves text alignment and target distribution fidelity without extra computational cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances adaptation and knowledge retention, integrating well with fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate camera spectral sensitivity is vital for tasks like color correction and material analysis, but existing methods rely on specialized tools.

Method: Uses an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet to capture images of direct and diffracted light, estimating sensitivity and grating parameters in closed-form.

Result: Outperforms conventional reference target-based methods in synthetic and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The method is effective, practical, and accessible, eliminating the need for specialized equipment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific

for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) for multi-object tracking (MOT) in autonomous vehicles, improving stability and accuracy by dynamically adapting to ego-vehicle speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT methods ignore ego-vehicle speed effects, degrading performance in dynamic scenarios.

Method: SG-LKF uses MotionScaleNet (MSNet) to adapt uncertainty modeling to speed and introduces a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss.

Result: SG-LKF achieves top performance on KITTI 2D/3D MOT and nuScenes 3D MOT benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses speed-induced tracking challenges, enhancing MOT accuracy in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoST, a unified spatio-temporal method for collaborative perception, improving efficiency and accuracy by merging multi-agent and multi-time fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies in prior methods that separate multi-agent and multi-time fusion, leading to redundant transmissions and suboptimal feature fusion.

Method: Aggregates observations from different agents and times into a unified spatio-temporal space, enabling single transmission per static object and holistic feature fusion.

Result: CoST improves efficiency (reduced bandwidth) and accuracy (better feature fusion), compatible with existing methods.

Conclusion: CoST offers a superior, efficient solution for collaborative perception by unifying spatio-temporal fusion.

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for honey botanical origin classification, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction by combining feature consistency loss and uncertainty-guided depth constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sparse-view reconstruction either generalize poorly to unseen views or lack detailed geometry due to limited clues.

Method: SparseRecon uses volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraints to enhance reconstruction quality.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially in scenarios with small overlapping views.

Conclusion: SparseRecon effectively addresses ambiguity and occlusion issues, producing high-quality reconstructions from sparse views.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Representation Shift, a training-free metric for token compression in Transformers, compatible with FlashAttention, improving efficiency without attention maps or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the quadratic cost of self-attention and GPU memory overhead in large Transformer models by enabling token compression without reliance on attention maps.

Method: Proposes Representation Shift, a model-agnostic metric measuring token representation changes, integrating seamlessly with FlashAttention.

Result: Achieves speedups of 5.5% in video-text retrieval and 4.4% in video QA, demonstrating effective token compression.

Conclusion: Representation Shift offers a practical solution for efficient token compression, compatible with modern attention optimizations like FlashAttention.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiAnt improves long-term action anticipation by combining forward and backward predictions using a large language model, outperforming unidirectional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unidirectional methods limit performance by failing to capture distinct sub-actions in scenes, hindering applications like automated driving and robotics.

Method: BiAnt integrates forward and backward predictions via a large language model to better model sub-actions.

Result: On Ego4D, BiAnt reduces edit distance, showing superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: BiAnt's bidirectional approach enhances action anticipation, addressing limitations of unidirectional methods.

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adapt-WeldNet, an adaptive framework for weld defect detection, and DDIA, an interpretability analysis framework, to improve performance and transparency in defect detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NDT methods and existing neural network approaches often fail to detect subtle defects and lack interpretability, posing safety risks in critical industries like oil and gas.

Method: The paper proposes Adapt-WeldNet for systematic evaluation of pre-trained architectures and hyperparameters, and DDIA using XAI techniques (Grad-CAM, LIME) with expert validation.

Result: The framework enhances defect detection performance and interpretability, validated by certified professionals, ensuring reliability and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: This work improves trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

*Won June Cho,Hongjun Yoon,Daeky Jeong,Hyeongyeol Lim,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with Vision Transformers (ViT) to predict spatial gene expression from histopathology images, outperforming ViT in robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics is costly and complex, so predicting gene expression from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative. Current ViT-based models underperform clinically.

Method: The authors propose $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone of SSMs and ViT, leveraging SSMs' low-frequency bias. They compare it with five other architectures pretrained on colorectal cancer datasets using DINOv2.

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than ViT in leave-one-study-out evaluation and shows 43% smaller performance degradation, demonstrating superior robustness and performance.

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$ outperforms ViT in gene expression prediction and other tasks, positioning it as a promising next-generation backbone for pathology vision foundation models.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

*Guanjie Huang,Danny H. K. Tsang,Shan Yang,Guangzhi Lei,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cued-Agent, a collaborative multi-agent system for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition (ACSR), addressing the challenge of temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements with specialized sub-agents and improved data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current ACSR methods, which struggle with multimodal fusion due to limited data and temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements.

Method: The method involves a multi-agent system (Cued-Agent) with four sub-agents: Hand Recognition, Lip Recognition, Hand Prompt Decoding, and Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word, leveraging multimodal fusion and semantic refinement.

Result: Experiments show Cued-Agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios, supported by an expanded Mandarin CS dataset.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Cued-Agent effectively addresses ACSR challenges, demonstrating superior performance and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAPT addresses information asymmetry in prompt tuning by decoupling visual modality into foreground and background, aligning them with text, and using visual pull-push regularization for unbiased attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies an information asymmetry issue in prompt tuning where visual modality dominates, leading to biased attention.

Method: Proposes DAPT, which decouples visual modality into foreground and background, aligns them with text, and applies visual pull-push regularization.

Result: DAPT achieves superior performance in few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning.

Conclusion: DAPT effectively mitigates information asymmetry and improves modal alignment in vision-language models.

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

TL;DR: A dual-branch framework detects AI-generated videos by combining RGB appearance features and optical flow residuals to capture spatial-temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos challenges existing forgery detection methods, which often miss fine-grained temporal inconsistencies in AI-generated content.

Method: The proposed framework uses a dual-branch architecture: one branch analyzes RGB frames for appearance artifacts, while the other processes optical flow residuals to detect motion anomalies.

Result: The method effectively detects forged videos, showing robustness and generalization across ten diverse generative models in text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging spatial-temporal consistency for improved video forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: iSafetyBench is a new video-language benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in industrial settings, focusing on routine and hazardous actions. Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, VLMs struggle with iSafetyBench, especially in hazardous scenarios and multi-label tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack evaluation in high-stakes industrial domains, where recognizing routine and hazardous actions is critical. iSafetyBench addresses this gap.

Method: The benchmark includes 1,100 real-world industrial video clips annotated with 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories, paired with multiple-choice questions for single- and multi-label evaluation.

Result: Eight state-of-the-art VLMs performed poorly on iSafetyBench, particularly in hazardous activity recognition and multi-label scenarios.

Conclusion: iSafetyBench highlights the need for more robust, safety-aware VLMs in industrial applications and serves as a testbed for future improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

*Tao Wu,Jingyuan Ye,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method (PMR) for restoring turbulence-degraded videos uses a Dynamic Efficiency Index (DEI) and a multi-stage framework to improve edge details and eliminate distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to restore edge details and handle mixed distortions in high-turbulence, dynamic scenes.

Method: Proposes DEI to quantify dynamic intensity and PMR, a three-stage framework (de-tilting, motion segmentation, de-blurring) with lightweight backbones.

Result: PMR effectively suppresses motion artifacts, restores edges, and generalizes well in real-world high-turbulence scenarios.

Conclusion: The method outperforms existing approaches and will release code and datasets.

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sortblock accelerates DiTs by dynamically caching block-wise features and skipping redundant computations, achieving 2x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs suffer from high inference latency due to sequential denoising, limiting real-time deployment. Existing methods overlook evolving semantic focus.

Method: Sortblock dynamically caches features based on similarity, ranks residuals for adaptive recomputation, and uses linear prediction to reduce errors.

Result: Achieves over 2x speedup with minimal quality degradation across tasks and DiT architectures.

Conclusion: Sortblock offers an effective, training-free solution for accelerating diffusion-based models while preserving quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

TL;DR: DC-AE 1.5 improves deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models by introducing structured latent space and augmented diffusion training, achieving faster convergence and better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue of slow convergence in diffusion models due to increased latent channels limits reconstruction quality and hinders the use of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios.

Method: Two innovations: 1) Structured Latent Space for channel-wise organization, and 2) Augmented Diffusion Training with additional objectives to accelerate convergence.

Result: DC-AE 1.5 outperforms DC-AE, delivering better image generation quality (e.g., on ImageNet 512x512) and being 4x faster.

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5 effectively addresses convergence and quality issues in latent diffusion models, enabling better performance and scalability.

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using video inpainting models for outpainting, introduces a hierarchical discriminator, and a specialized loss function to improve visual and global coherence, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outpainting methods focus on background generation, but lack consistency. Video inpainting models show promise but fail when directly applied due to blurry results.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical discriminator for global and local adversarial training and a specialized outpainting loss function leveraging discriminator features.

Result: The method produces visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses outpainting challenges by refining adversarial training and loss functions, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

TL;DR: UIS-Mamba introduces Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW) modules to adapt Mamba for underwater instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scenes pose challenges like color distortion and blurred boundaries, making existing fixed-patch scanning mechanisms ineffective for instance continuity.

Method: Proposes UIS-Mamba with DTS (dynamic patch adjustment) and HSW (background suppression) modules to enhance Mamba's suitability for underwater tasks.

Result: Achieves top performance on UIIS and USIS10K datasets with low computational complexity.

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba effectively addresses underwater segmentation challenges, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

*Seunggeun Chi,Enna Sachdeva,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method for amodal completion in HOI scenarios uses physical priors and multi-regional inpainting to improve accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with plausible completions in dynamic HOI scenarios due to limited understanding of interactions.

Method: Incorporates physical constraints (human topology, contact info) and uses multi-regional inpainting with customized denoising in a diffusion model.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, enhancing shape and visual detail realism. Robust even without ground-truth contact annotations.

Conclusion: Advances machine perception towards human-like understanding of dynamic environments, with broader applicability in tasks like 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

### [47] [Reducing the gap between general purpose data and aerial images in concentrated solar power plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00440)
*M. A. P√©rez-Cuti√±o,J. Valverde,J. Capit√°n,J. M. D√≠az-B√°√±ez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AerialCSP, a synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, to reduce manual labeling needs and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack domain-specific elements for CSP plants, making model generalization difficult without costly manual labeling.

Method: Creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset simulating CSP plant imagery, to pretrain models and benchmark performance.

Result: Pretraining on AerialCSP improves real-world fault detection, especially for rare and small defects.

Conclusion: AerialCSP effectively reduces manual labeling efforts and enhances model performance for CSP plant inspections.

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

*Jiale Zhou,Wenhan Wang,Shikun Li,Xiaolei Qu,Xin Guo,Yizhong Liu,Wenzhong Tang,Xun Lin,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoTTA is a test-time adaptation framework for tubular structure segmentation, addressing domain shifts with topology-enhanced methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in tubular structure segmentation degrade performance, especially due to topological sensitivity.

Method: Two-stage approach: TopoMDCs for topological adaptation and TopoHG for continuity improvement with pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves 31.81% average improvement in clDice across four scenarios and ten datasets.

Conclusion: TopoTTA effectively handles topological shifts and is a plug-and-play solution for CNN-based TSS models.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

*Longfei Huang,Yu Liang,Hao Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Wei Dong,Lunde Chen,Wanyu Liu,Bo Li,Pengtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDMatte is a diffusion-driven interactive matting model that leverages diffusion models' priors for fine-grained detail extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive matting methods lack precision in edge regions, while diffusion models excel in detail synthesis and interaction, making them ideal for this task.

Method: SDMatte transforms text-driven interaction into visual prompt-driven interaction, integrates coordinate and opacity embeddings into U-Net, and uses masked self-attention for focused processing.

Result: Experiments show SDMatte's superior performance in interactive matting, especially in capturing fine details.

Conclusion: SDMatte effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by leveraging diffusion models, offering improved detail extraction and interaction.

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

*Hongyi Cai,Mohammad Mahdinur Rahman,Mingkang Dong,Jie Li,Muxin Pu,Zhili Fang,Yinan Peng,Hanjun Luo,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias is a framework that automatically detects and mitigates social biases in Text-to-Image models without prior bias knowledge, using vision-language models and inclusive prompts to ensure fairness while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image models often exhibit unintended social biases, even without explicit prompts, and existing debiasing methods struggle with subtle or overlapping biases.

Method: AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect biases, constructs inclusive alternative prompts, and uses CLIP-guided training to promote fairness without compromising image quality.

Result: AutoDebias achieves 91.6% accuracy in detecting biases, reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, and preserves visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AutoDebias effectively addresses subtle and overlapping biases in T2I models, offering a scalable and automated solution for fairness.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

*Anju Rani,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTime is a multimodal framework built on CLIP to predict fungal growth stages and timestamps from images and text, improving temporal understanding in biological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models like CLIP lack effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics, which is crucial for biological growth analysis.

Method: CLIPTime extends CLIP to jointly predict developmental stages (classification) and timestamps (regression) using synthetic fungal growth data.

Result: CLIPTime successfully models biological progression and provides interpretable, time-aware predictions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of vision-language models for real-world biological monitoring by addressing temporal limitations.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

*Baisong Li,Xingwang Wang,Haixiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIF-Net is a novel framework for multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task with invertible Mamba architecture and a Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and data misalignment make MHIF fundamentally ill-posed, which prior methods have not effectively addressed.

Method: PIF-Net uses an invertible Mamba architecture for global spectral modeling and a Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module for dynamic feature calibration.

Result: PIF-Net achieves superior image restoration performance on benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PIF-Net effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of MHIF, balancing spectral and spatial information with a lightweight and efficient design.

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR models struggle with fidelity alignment and temporal consistency due to uncontrolled generation processes.

Method: Proposes SeTe-VSR, using semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in latent diffusion space to balance detail recovery and coherence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in detail recovery and perceptual quality, maintaining high-reality visuals.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR is effective for complex VSR tasks, offering superior fidelity and temporal alignment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyPCV-Former, a hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer, improves video anomaly detection by leveraging Lorentzian hyperbolic space for hierarchical event modeling and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains fail to capture hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity in video anomaly detection.

Method: HyPCV-Former extracts spatial features from point cloud sequences, embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, and uses a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism for temporal modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7% improvement on TIMo and 5.6% on DAD datasets.

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former effectively addresses limitations of Euclidean representations, offering superior anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: LAMIC is a training-free framework for multi-reference image synthesis, enhancing layout control and consistency with novel attention mechanisms and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coherent and consistent image generation from multiple references with spatial layout awareness.

Method: Extends single-reference diffusion models to multi-reference scenarios using Group Isolation Attention (GIA) and Region-Modulated Attention (RMA). Introduces metrics like IN-R, FI-R, and BG-S for evaluation.

Result: LAMIC outperforms existing baselines in layout control, background consistency, and identity preservation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.

Conclusion: LAMIC sets a new training-free paradigm for multi-image composition, leveraging advanced single-reference models for zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

TL;DR: LesiOnTime improves small lesion segmentation in breast DCE-MRI by integrating longitudinal imaging and BI-RADS scores, outperforming baselines by 5% Dice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods focus on large lesions and ignore longitudinal and clinical data, which are crucial for early cancer detection.

Method: Proposes a 3D segmentation approach with Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) for dynamic integration of past and current scans, and BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) for latent space alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% Dice on a high-risk patient dataset, with TPA and BCR providing complementary gains.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal and clinical context enhances early lesion segmentation reliability in breast cancer screening.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: Unsupervised pipeline for labeling Sentinel-2 imagery using segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks, improving robustness and granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling remote sensing imagery is costly and time-consuming; existing methods rely on pre-labeled data. This work aims to create an unsupervised solution for accurate and efficient labeling.

Method: Combines segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to group pixels into homogeneous regions, encoding robust features while preserving local and neighborhood information.

Result: Reduces labeling outliers, enables granular labeling, and forms rotationally invariant semantic relationships in the encoding space.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes limitations of prior methods, offering a more efficient and accurate unsupervised labeling tool for remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Motivation: Egocentric video grounding is underexplored compared to exocentric videos, despite its importance in applications like augmented reality and robotics. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing discrepancies and providing resources for egocentric video understanding.

Method: The authors introduce EgoMask, a pixel-level benchmark, and an automatic annotation pipeline for egocentric videos. They also create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset, and evaluate state-of-the-art models on their benchmark.

Result: Existing models perform poorly on EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements while maintaining performance on exocentric datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding, with code and datasets made publicly available.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing

TL;DR: EPANet, an efficient path aggregation network, improves underwater fish detection by combining complementary features with lightweight design, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater fish detection is challenging due to low resolution, background interference, and visual similarity. Existing methods are either complex or inefficient.

Method: EPANet uses EPA-FPN for semantic-spatial complementarity and MS-DDSP bottleneck for feature diversity, enhancing detection without increasing complexity.

Result: EPANet achieves higher accuracy and faster inference than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low parameter complexity.

Conclusion: EPANet provides an efficient and accurate solution for underwater fish detection, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

### [61] [Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00548)
*Seunghyun Shin,Dongmin Shin,Jisu Shin,Hae-Gon Jeon,Joon-Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reference-based video color grading framework using a diffusion model to generate LUTs for artistic color adjustments, preserving structural details and incorporating user preferences via text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video color grading is complex and requires professional skills; the paper aims to simplify this process for artistic or storytelling purposes.

Method: Uses a diffusion model to generate LUTs for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video, enforcing high-level feature similarity and incorporating user preferences via text prompts.

Result: Achieves effective video color grading without structural detail loss, with fast inference and user preference integration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully simplifies professional-grade video color grading, validated by user studies and experimental results.

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly

### [62] [Your other Left! Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00549)
*Daniel Wolf,Heiko Hillenhagen,Billurvan Taskin,Alex B√§uerle,Meinrad Beer,Michael G√∂tz,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with determining relative positions in medical images, despite visual prompts. A new benchmark, MIRP, is introduced to evaluate this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding relative positions in medical images is crucial for clinical decision-making, but current VLMs lack this ability.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, JanusPro) and tested visual prompts (alphanumeric/colored markers) for improvement.

Result: VLMs performed poorly on medical images, relying more on prior knowledge than image content. Visual prompts offered only moderate improvements.

Conclusion: A benchmark dataset (MIRP) is introduced to advance research on VLMs' ability to identify relative positions in medical imaging.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

### [63] [DBLP: Noise Bridge Consistency Distillation For Efficient And Reliable Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00552)
*Chihan Huang,Belal Alsinglawi,Islam Al-qudah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBLP introduces an efficient diffusion-based adversarial purification method using noise bridge distillation and adaptive semantic enhancement, achieving SOTA performance and near real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and existing purification methods are inefficient due to iterative denoising.

Method: Proposes Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP) with noise bridge distillation and adaptive semantic enhancement using multi-scale pyramid edge maps.

Result: DBLP achieves SOTA robust accuracy, superior image quality, and ~0.2s inference time.

Conclusion: DBLP significantly advances real-time adversarial purification with efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

### [64] [HiPrune: Training-Free Visual Token Pruning via Hierarchical Attention in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00553)
*Jizhihui Liu,Feiyi Du,Guangdao Zhu,Niu Lian,Jun Li,Bin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPrune is a training-free, model-agnostic token pruning framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that leverages hierarchical attention to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from excessive computational overhead due to lengthy visual token sequences. Existing methods rely on special tokens or task-specific training, limiting scalability.

Method: HiPrune identifies and prunes tokens hierarchically: Anchor (object-centric), Buffer (spatial continuity), and Register (global summarization) tokens, without retraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art pruning, preserving 99.3% accuracy with 33.3% tokens and 99.5% with 11.1% tokens, reducing FLOPs and latency by up to 9x.

Conclusion: HiPrune is scalable, efficient, and generalizes well across models and tasks, offering significant computational savings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeCP is a training-free class purification framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, addressing class redundancy and visual-language ambiguity to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods for OVSS overlook challenges like class redundancy and visual-language ambiguity, leading to suboptimal results. FreeCP aims to purify semantic categories and rectify these issues.

Method: FreeCP purifies semantic categories and corrects errors from redundancy and ambiguity, leveraging these purified representations for final segmentation predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks show FreeCP significantly enhances segmentation performance when integrated with other OVSS methods.

Conclusion: FreeCP effectively addresses key challenges in OVSS, improving performance without additional training, making it a valuable plug-and-play module.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

*Stefan Englmeier,Max A. B√ºttner,Katharina Winter,Fabian B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel context-aware motion retrieval framework is proposed for identifying rare human behaviors in autonomous driving datasets, improving retrieval accuracy by 27.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems need reliable evaluation in safety-critical scenarios involving unusual VRU behaviors, which are hard to find in large datasets.

Method: Combines SMPL-based motion sequences and video frames, encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language for text-based retrieval.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% in motion-context retrieval on the WayMoCo dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable retrieval of human behavior for robust autonomous driving evaluation, supported by the new WayMoCo dataset.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysNAP is a diffusion model-based method for generating articulated objects aligned with partial point clouds, ensuring physical plausibility through SDFs and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects are common in everyday environments, but generating them with physical plausibility and alignment to partial point clouds is challenging.

Method: The model uses SDFs for part shapes, guides diffusion with point cloud alignment loss, and enforces non-penetration and mobility constraints. It is also category-aware for better alignment.

Result: Evaluated on PartNet-Mobility, PhysNAP improves constraint consistency and offers a tradeoff with generative ability compared to an unguided baseline.

Conclusion: PhysNAP effectively generates physically plausible articulated objects aligned with partial point clouds, outperforming unguided diffusion models.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

*Hannah Kniesel,Leon Sick,Tristan Payer,Tim Bergner,Kavitha Shaga Devan,Clarissa Read,Paul Walther,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised object detection method using image-level annotations to avoid costly bounding box annotations, outperforming other weak labeling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the cost and effort of obtaining expert-annotated bounding boxes for object detection in specialized domains.

Method: Distills knowledge from a pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels via an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field.

Result: Pseudo-labels outperform other weak labeling methods and even ground truth labels when annotation time is limited.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently reduces annotation costs while maintaining or improving detection performance.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

*Jingchao Xie,Oussema Dhaouadi,Weirong Chen,Johannes Meier,Jacques Kaiser,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoProU-VO introduces cross-frame uncertainty propagation to improve unsupervised visual odometry in dynamic scenes, outperforming prior methods on KITTI and nuScenes datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised VO struggles with dynamic objects violating static scene assumptions, leading to pose errors. Existing uncertainty models ignore temporal uncertainty propagation.

Method: CoProU-VO combines target and reference frame uncertainties using a probabilistic approach, leveraging vision transformers for joint depth, uncertainty, and pose learning.

Result: Significant improvements over unsupervised monocular methods, especially in dynamic highway scenes, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: Cross-frame uncertainty propagation enhances robustness in dynamic scenes, making CoProU-VO a strong solution for unsupervised VO.

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

*Marc H√∂lle,Walter Kellermann,Vasileios Belagiannis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method to improve semantic segmentation by distinguishing known and unknown objects in autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation models often misclassify unknown objects in real-world scenarios, and existing methods struggle with rare or complex scenes.

Method: The approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test, accounting for uncertainty by outputting probability distributions instead of point estimates.

Result: The method achieves a 2.5% false positive rate, 90.91% precision, and negligible computational overhead on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty improves outlier exposure, making the method effective for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

*Yihe Tian,Kwan Man Cheng,Zhengbo Zhang,Tao Zhang,Suju Li,Dongmei Yan,Bing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVAL, a framework to reconstruct extended VIIRS-like artificial nighttime light data for China, addressing limitations in current methods and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NTL data lacks long-term coverage and suffers from underestimation and structural omission, limiting historical analysis.

Method: A two-stage framework: construction with a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) and refinement using a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR) with high-resolution impervious surface masks.

Result: EVAL extends data back to 1986, outperforms existing products (R¬≤: 0.68‚Üí0.80, RMSE: 1.27‚Üí0.99), and shows strong temporal and socioeconomic consistency.

Conclusion: EVAL provides a reliable, high-quality resource for long-term NTL studies and is publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

TL;DR: Wukong is a transformer-based NSFW detection framework for T2I generation, leveraging early denoising steps and pre-trained U-Net cross-attention for efficient and accurate detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NSFW safeguards (text or image filters) are either inefficient or prone to adversarial attacks, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Wukong uses intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's cross-attention parameters for early detection within the diffusion process.

Result: Wukong outperforms text-based safeguards and matches image filters' accuracy while being more efficient.

Conclusion: Wukong provides an effective and efficient solution for NSFW detection in T2I generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

*Jiajun Le,Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMoE introduces a Mixture-of-Experts framework for two-view geometry, addressing heterogeneous motion patterns with targeted modeling, outperforming prior methods in pose and homography estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle diverse motion patterns in complex scenes, leading to inaccurate motion fields. GeoMoE aims to improve this by leveraging MoE for targeted sub-field modeling.

Method: GeoMoE uses a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition to split the motion field into sub-fields and an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier for targeted modeling, reducing bias and interference.

Result: GeoMoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose and homography estimation, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: GeoMoE's minimalist and targeted approach effectively addresses heterogeneous motion patterns, improving accuracy in two-view geometry tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior is challenging due to pose complexity and lack of high-quality datasets.

Method: DPoser-X uses a diffusion model for pose prior, solves tasks via variational diffusion sampling, and employs truncated timestep scheduling and masked training for better performance.

Result: DPoser-X outperforms state-of-the-art models in body, hand, face, and full-body pose benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPoser-X sets a new benchmark for whole-body human pose prior modeling, demonstrating robustness and versatility.

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Result: The attacks successfully backdoor face detection systems, demonstrating their vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the risks in face detection systems and suggests mitigations to address these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture
images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face
poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that
regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face
Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time
a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

*Luisa Gall√©e,Catharina Silvia Lisson,Christoph Gerhard Lisson,Daniela Drees,Felix Weig,Daniel Vogele,Meinrad Beer,Michael G√∂tz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a generative Diffusion Model to synthesize attribute-annotated medical images, addressing the scarcity of labeled datasets. This enhances explainable AI models, improving attribute and target prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust and usability of AI in medical diagnosis by aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning, despite limited attribute-annotated datasets.

Method: Enhance a Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning, train it on a small labeled dataset (LIDC-IDRI), and use synthetic data to train an explainable model.

Result: Synthetic data boosts attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to using only real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can overcome dataset limitations, enhancing explainable AI models in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

### [77] [Revisiting Adversarial Patch Defenses on Object Detectors: Unified Evaluation, Large-Scale Dataset, and New Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00649)
*Junhao Zheng,Jiahao Sun,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Chen Ma,Chong Zhang,Cong Wang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified benchmark for evaluating patch attack defenses on object detectors, revealing key insights and improving defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense evaluations lack consistency and comprehensiveness, necessitating a standardized framework.

Method: The study revisits 11 defenses, creates a benchmark with 2 attack goals, 13 attacks, 11 detectors, and 4 metrics, and introduces a large-scale dataset.

Result: Key findings include the role of data distribution in defense difficulty, the importance of average precision over patch detection accuracy, and the robustness of complex/stochastic defenses.

Conclusion: The benchmark and insights aim to guide future evaluations and designs of patch attack defenses.

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

*Hongfei Zhang,Kun Zhou,Ruizheng Wu,Jiangbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using pretrained depth representations for image dehazing, proposing a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module for adaptability across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dehazing methods lack adaptability due to architecture-specific designs, despite the promise of large-scale pretrained models.

Method: Systematic investigation of pretrained depth representations for dehazing, leading to a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module.

Result: Learned deep depth features show consistency across haze levels; the proposed module is effective and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: The RGB-D fusion module enhances dehazing adaptability and performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

*Chende Zheng,Ruiqi suo,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Shuai Liu,Minghui Yang,Cong Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D3, a training-free method for detecting AI-generated videos by analyzing second-order temporal artifacts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public concern over synthetic video dissemination and the lack of temporal artifact exploration in current detection methods.

Method: Proposes D3, leveraging second-order dynamical analysis and Second-order Central Difference features for temporal artifact detection.

Result: D3 outperforms previous methods by 10.39% mean Average Precision on Gen-Video and shows computational efficiency.

Conclusion: D3 is a robust and efficient solution for detecting AI-generated videos, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

### [80] [MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00726)
*Jiale Li,Mingrui Wu,Zixiang Jin,Hao Chen,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIHBench, a benchmark for evaluating object-related hallucinations in multi-image Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifying key factors and proposing a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on hallucination in MLLMs focus on single-image settings, leaving multi-image scenarios unexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The study proposes MIHBench with three tasks to evaluate hallucinations. It identifies key factors and introduces a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism to adjust inter-image attention.

Result: Key findings include the relationship between image inputs and hallucination likelihood, and the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism improves semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image MLLMs, addressing previously unexplored challenges.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

TL;DR: YOLO-Count is a differentiable model for open-vocabulary object counting and precise quantity control in text-to-image generation, using a novel 'cardinality' map and hybrid supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in general object counting and enable precise quantity control in text-to-image generation.

Method: Introduces a 'cardinality' map for regression, uses representation alignment, and employs hybrid strong-weak supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy and robust quantity control for T2I systems.

Conclusion: YOLO-Count effectively bridges open-vocabulary counting and generative model control, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

*Adwait Chandorkar,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone for 3D object detection, reducing model complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based 3D object detection relies on complex backbones (VGG/ResNet), limiting efficiency. Lightweight backbones for 3D detection are underexplored.

Method: Proposes Dense Backbone, a lightweight design, and integrates it with existing detectors like PillarNet (DensePillarNet).

Result: DensePillarNet reduces parameters by 29% and latency by 28%, with only a 2% accuracy drop on nuScenes.

Conclusion: Dense Backbone offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient 3D object detection without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

*Regine Hartwig,Dominik Muhle,Riccardo Marin,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GECO introduces a self-supervised vision model for geometrically coherent feature learning, outperforming prior methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised vision models lack 3D geometry awareness, limiting their ability to distinguish parts based on geometry.

Method: Uses optimal transport for training, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions. Lightweight architecture ensures real-time performance.

Result: Achieves 30 fps (98.2% faster than prior methods) and improves PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1% on PFPascal, APK, and CUB datasets.

Conclusion: PCK alone is insufficient for geometric quality; new metrics are introduced for more geometry-aware feature learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using facial motion patterns as behavioral biometrics for identity verification in photorealistic avatar-mediated communication, proposing a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network with temporal attention pooling for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security risks like impersonation in avatar-based communication by verifying identity through unique facial motion cues.

Method: Introduces a dataset of genuine and impostor avatar videos using GAGAvatar, and a spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network with temporal attention pooling for facial landmark analysis.

Result: Facial motion cues achieve ~80% AUC in identity verification, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar systems, providing a benchmark and system for further research.

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

*Prerana Ramkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN enhances satellite imagery super-resolution by integrating semantic consistency and uncertainty maps, outperforming ESRGAN in critical applications like disaster response and urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence in super-resolution, limiting their use in critical remote sensing tasks.

Method: SU-ESRGAN combines ESRGAN, DeepLabv3 for segmentation loss, and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty maps.

Result: Achieves comparable PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS to ESRGAN, with better adaptation to domain-specific datasets.

Conclusion: Domain-aware training is crucial for super-resolution in remote sensing, and SU-ESRGAN's modular design is versatile for UAV and satellite applications.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

*Irene Iele,Francesco Di Feola,Valerio Guarrasi,Paolo Soda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework is proposed for medical image-to-image translation, dynamically adjusting the process to handle out-of-distribution samples without degrading performance on in-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-image translation techniques in medical imaging struggle with out-of-distribution samples, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block to selectively modify features of a pretrained model.

Result: Demonstrates improvements in low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation over baseline and prior TTA methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sample-specific adaptation improves model resilience, addressing limitations of uniform adaptation methods.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

*Zihan Wang,Samira Ebrahimi Kahou,Narges Armanfard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PILOT introduces a dual-branch prompt learning mechanism and label-free test-time adaptation to improve zero-shot anomaly detection under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods struggle with domain shifts due to limited training data and lack of generalization.

Method: PILOT uses a dual-branch prompt learning mechanism and label-free test-time adaptation with pseudo-labels.

Result: PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 benchmarks for anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

Conclusion: PILOT effectively addresses domain shift challenges in zero-shot anomaly detection with its innovative framework.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

TL;DR: The study evaluates semantic segmentation in heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets for public safety, highlighting challenges like class imbalance and label unification, and suggests standardized protocols and improved labeling for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D point-cloud datasets for public safety applications, particularly in pre-incident planning systems.

Method: Uses NIST's Point Cloud City dataset with a graded schema and KPConv architecture, evaluating performance via IoU metrics on safety-relevant features.

Result: Performance varies: large objects (e.g., stairs, windows) segment well, while smaller safety-critical features perform poorly due to class imbalance and geometric limitations in lidar scans.

Conclusion: Reliable segmentation for public safety requires standardized annotation and better labeling techniques to handle data heterogeneity and detect small, critical elements.

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

*Wenxuan Guo,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Ziwei Wang,Jianjiang Feng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGL-Nav is a novel framework for image-goal navigation using incremental 3D Gaussian localization, outperforming existing methods by leveraging geometric information and efficient 3D-aware techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for image-goal navigation struggle with modeling geometric relationships between the environment and goal image, and are computationally inefficient.

Method: IGL-Nav incrementally updates scene representation with monocular prediction, coarsely localizes the goal using geometric matching, and refines the pose via differentiable rendering.

Result: IGL-Nav significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and handles free-view image-goal settings, even on real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an efficient and accurate solution for 3D-aware image-goal navigation, with practical applicability.

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

*Fred Mutisya,Shikoh Gitau,Nasubo Ongoma,Keith Mbae,Elizabeth Wamicha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthBench benchmarks AI health systems but risks bias due to expert reliance. Proposed solution: use evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for fairer, globally relevant evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in HealthBench from expert opinions and automated grading, especially in low-resource settings like Africa, by grounding evaluations in rigorous clinical evidence.

Method: Link rubrics to version-controlled CPGs with systematic reviews and GRADE ratings, implement evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override logic.

Result: Aims to create more equitable, clinically trustworthy AI evaluations by integrating ethical considerations and delayed feedback.

Conclusion: Evidence-based CPGs can improve HealthBench, ensuring globally relevant, ethically sound medical AI models.

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems
for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model
evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics.
However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical
evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician
idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading
systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income
settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and
region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity,
inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the
urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address
these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and
GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via
rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override
logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of
delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs,
while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to
foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but

### [91] [Hyperproperty-Constrained Secure Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00106)
*Ernest Bonnah,Luan Viet Nguyen,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL) for robotics, addressing security-aware RL using hyperproperties. A dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL method is proposed and validated with a robotic case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe reinforcement learning (SRL) lacks exploration of security-aware RL using hyperproperties, despite their effectiveness in robotics applications.

Method: Proposes a dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL approach to learn security-aware policies under HyperTWTL constraints, formalized as MDPs.

Result: The method outperforms baseline RL algorithms in a pick-up and delivery robotic mission, demonstrating effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: HyperTWTL-constrained SecRL is a viable approach for security-aware policy learning in robotics, with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a
domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in
compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for
robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure
reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe
reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several
existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring
security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the
dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security
constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning
security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while
satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our
proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission
case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms,
showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

*Wil M. P. van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI's industrial application faces challenges; Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) bridges data and processes, enabling AI in organizations as Process Intelligence (PI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations struggle to apply AI effectively in dynamic, process-driven industrial settings.

Method: Uses OCPM to structure process-related data, enabling generative, predictive, and prescriptive AI.

Result: OCPM connects data and processes, forming PI, which enhances AI's operational impact.

Conclusion: AI requires PI (via OCPM) for successful industrial application, offering opportunities for combining AI types.

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,
do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI
successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end
operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and
prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving
such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric
Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and
organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.
OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different
forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the
amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a
variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.
This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and
highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,
predictive, and prescriptive AI.

*Agust√≠n Borda,Juan Bautista Cabral,Gonzalo Giarda,Diego Nicol√°s Gimenez Irusta,Paula Pacheco,Alvaro Roy Schachner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces three tests to detect Rank Reversals in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, implemented in Scikit-Criteria, and discusses their impact on evaluating decision methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank Reversals in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis can distort results, necessitating tools to measure method performance and compare effectiveness.

Method: Three tests are developed to detect Rank Reversals, implemented in Scikit-Criteria, with design considerations for general scenarios.

Result: The tests enable detection of Rank Reversals, aiding in evaluating decision methods' robustness.

Conclusion: These tests enhance the assessment of multi-criteria decision methods, improving their reliability for problem-solving.

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem
that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against
a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism
that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of
alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the
effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we
present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with
their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the
complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios
and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a
discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of
multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

*Shqiponja Ahmetaj,George Konstantinidis,Magdalena Ortiz,Paolo Pareti,Mantas Simkus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies SHACL validation in RDF graphs under updates, introduces a SHACL-based update language, and reduces static validation to SHACL constraint (un)satisfiability. It analyzes computational complexity and presents a prototype for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring RDF graphs remain valid under updates while adhering to SHACL constraints.

Method: Uses a regression technique to embed update actions into SHACL constraints, reducing static validation to SHACL (un)satisfiability. Computational complexity is analyzed for SHACL and key fragments.

Result: Shows static validation under updates can be reduced to SHACL (un)satisfiability. A prototype demonstrates feasibility.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for reasoning about evolving RDF graphs and validates the approach through a prototype.

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language
for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under
updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive
and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static
validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph
that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given
update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for
reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds
the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under
updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor
extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static
validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a
prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static
analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through
preliminary experiments.

*Rashid Mushkani,Hugo Berard,Toumadher Ammar,Cassandre Chatonnier,Shin Koseki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a re-architected AI lifecycle centered on co-production, DEI, and multidisciplinary collaboration to mitigate harms to marginalized groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI algorithms disproportionately impact marginalized groups, and current mitigation efforts (ethical guidelines, technical fairness solutions) are insufficient.

Method: Introduces a participatory AI lifecycle with five phases (co-framing, co-design, co-implementation, co-deployment, co-maintenance), informed by workshops and themes of distributed authority and iterative knowledge exchange.

Result: A novel AI lifecycle framework that aligns with ethical frameworks and emphasizes participatory governance.

Conclusion: Scaling participatory governance in AI production requires addressing key research questions, with the proposed lifecycle as a foundational step.

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact
culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to
address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines
and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote
algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and
recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms
requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This
re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and
multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle
consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design,
co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed
by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed
authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed
lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research
questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

*Danielle R. Thomas,Conrad Borchers,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques overreliance on human inter-rater reliability (IRR) for annotation quality in educational AI, proposing complementary methods like multi-label schemes and expert-based approaches to improve validity and learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluators are often biased and unreliable, yet IRR metrics like Cohen's kappa dominate AI training data validation, potentially hindering progress in educational applications.

Method: The paper highlights five alternative evaluation methods, such as multi-label annotation and close-the-loop validity, to supplement or replace IRR.

Result: These methods aim to produce more valid, predictive, and actionable training data and models, improving student learning outcomes.

Conclusion: The field should prioritize validity and educational impact over consensus, redefining annotation quality and ground truth in educational AI.

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased,
unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to
produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,
traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain
central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine
learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification
of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded
assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a
gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways
that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address
this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,
such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and
close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better
position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved
student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We
also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by
establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it
works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call
on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing
validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

### [97] [Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159)
*Jobst Heitzig,Ram Potham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to ensure AI safety and human wellbeing by designing an objective function that empowers humans and manages power balance between humans and AI. It uses a principled approach and derives algorithms for computation, suggesting it as a safer alternative to direct utility-based objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AI safety and human wellbeing by managing power dynamics between humans and AI, considering diverse human goals and bounded rationality.

Method: Designs a parametrizable, decomposable objective function for human power, considering inequality and risk. Derives algorithms for computation via backward induction or multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Result: Demonstrates the implications of maximizing human power metrics in various scenarios, suggesting safer instrumental sub-goals for AI systems.

Conclusion: Softly maximizing aggregate human power metrics may be a safer and beneficial objective for AI systems compared to direct utility-based objectives.

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal,
sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI
interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the
ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by
forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance
between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially
axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective
function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of
human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social
norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or
approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given
world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric
in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental
sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly
maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a
beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct
utility-based objectives.

*Yihong Dong,Xue Jiang,Yongding Tao,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Lili Mou,Rongyu Cao,Yingwei Ma,Jue Chen,Binhua Li,Zhi Jin,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-PLUS improves reasoning in LLMs by combining internal and external learning, outperforming RLVR methods and avoiding capability collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR's limitations in breaking LLM boundaries and causing capability collapse motivate the need for a better approach.

Method: RL-PLUS integrates Multiple Importance Sampling and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to enhance reasoning.

Result: RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance on math and out-of-distribution tasks, with 21.1% to 69.2% improvements.

Conclusion: RL-PLUS effectively surpasses base model boundaries and resolves capability collapse, proving superior to RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly
advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent is a self-improving AI agent that learns by doing, using adaptive help-seeking, self-reflection, and dynamic knowledge integration to outperform baselines on knowledge discovery tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an agent that evolves its expertise through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement without model parameter updates or post-training.

Method: MetaAgent starts with basic reasoning and help-seeking, generates help requests, routes them to tools, conducts self-reflection, and builds a knowledge base and tools from its history.

Result: Outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches/exceeds end-to-end trained agents on benchmarks like GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp.

Conclusion: MetaAgent demonstrates the potential of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Chunhui Zhang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares human and LLM (GPT-4o) task generation, finding humans are driven by psychological factors, while LLMs produce less social, physical, and more abstract tasks, despite being perceived as more fun and novel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs simulate human-like cognitive principles in task generation, particularly the role of psychological drivers.

Method: A task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of GPT-4o, even when psychological drivers were provided to the LLM.

Result: Humans' task generation is influenced by personal values and cognitive style, while LLMs produce less social, less physical, and more abstract tasks, despite being seen as more fun and novel.

Conclusion: A gap exists between human cognition (value-driven, embodied) and LLMs (statistical patterns), suggesting the need for intrinsic motivation and physical grounding in human-aligned agents.

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

*Jianyi Zhang,Xu Ji,Ziyin Zhou,Yuchen Zhou,Shubo Shi,Haoyu Wu,Zhen Li,Shizhao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasonBench is a new benchmark for evaluating VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, revealing their limitations and proposing optimization strategies (DiaCoT and ReasonTune) to improve performance by 33.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack human-level graphic reasoning, especially in complex tasks. Existing studies focus on simple graphics, leaving a gap in evaluating complex reasoning.

Method: Proposed ReasonBench, a benchmark with 1,613 structured graphic reasoning questions, and tested 11 VLMs. Introduced DiaCoT for interpretability and ReasonTune for adaptability.

Result: VLMs show significant limitations in complex reasoning. DiaCoT and ReasonTune improved performance by 33.5%.

Conclusion: ReasonBench highlights VLMs' shortcomings in complex reasoning. Proposed optimizations offer significant performance improvements, paving the way for better VLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic
reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still
show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning
capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem
solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple
graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we
propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured
graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world
intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to
location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and
abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including
closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of
current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization
strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability
of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task
adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM
performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository:

TL;DR: R1-Act is a post-training method that activates safety knowledge in large reasoning models (LRMs) to reduce harmful outputs, improving safety without compromising reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often fulfill harmful instructions despite having safety knowledge, posing risks. The study aims to address this by activating latent safety knowledge.

Method: Proposes R1-Act, a post-training method that triggers safety knowledge via structured reasoning, requiring minimal training data and resources.

Result: R1-Act significantly improves safety while maintaining reasoning performance, outperforming prior methods with just 1,000 examples and 90 minutes of training.

Conclusion: R1-Act is robust, scalable, and efficient, offering a practical solution to enhance LRM safety.

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

*Shixin Yi,Lin Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRGI introduces visual verification into Chain-of-Thought prompting to reduce hallucinations in vision-language models, improving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of linguistically fluent but visually ungrounded explanations in CoT prompting for VLMs.

Method: CoRGI uses a three-stage pipeline: generating textual reasoning, extracting visual evidence, and synthesizing grounded answers.

Result: Improves reasoning on VCR benchmark with Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6, confirmed by human evaluations.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning steps in visual evidence enhances robustness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multi-agent cooperation method using theory of mind (ToM) within active inference, enabling agents to infer others' beliefs without shared models or explicit communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-agent cooperation by leveraging ToM to understand and reason about others' beliefs and goals, avoiding reliance on task-specific shared models or communication.

Method: Extends inference tree-based planning with recursive reasoning, maintaining distinct representations of self and others' beliefs and goals. Evaluated in collision avoidance and foraging tasks.

Result: ToM-equipped agents outperform non-ToM agents in cooperation, avoiding collisions and reducing redundant efforts by inferring others' beliefs from behavior.

Conclusion: The approach advances AI applications and provides computational insights into ToM, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory
of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that
others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about
others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active
inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on
task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,
while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains
distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend
the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically
explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is
evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results
demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM
counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.
Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from
observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial
intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web

Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our

Motivation: To understand why LLMs excel in coding but struggle with formal mathematics, and to identify the underlying reasons for these discrepancies.

Method: Analyzes recent models and benchmarks, focusing on three central issues: training domains, proof generation brittleness, and logical state representation.

Result: Highlights the difficulties in formal mathematics for LLMs, such as the brittleness of proof generation and unclear logical state tracking.

Conclusion: Aims to identify current limitations and potential extensions for LLMs in formal mathematics, without drawing definitive boundaries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured
reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of
strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to
mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving.
However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more
difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof
construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs
``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion
of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the
state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,
and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and
mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal
mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation
remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether
LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal
is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie,
and how they might be extended.

### [107] [Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500)
*Haoyu Wang,Chris M. Poskitt,Jun Sun,Jiali Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pro2Guard is a proactive framework using probabilistic reachability analysis to anticipate and mitigate safety risks in LLM agents, outperforming reactive rule-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based safety systems for LLM agents are reactive and lack foresight, struggling with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts.

Method: Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states, learns a DTMC from traces, and uses probabilistic reachability to predict and intervene before unsafe states are reached.

Result: Pro2Guard achieves 93.6% early safety enforcement in household agents and 100% violation prediction in autonomous driving, with risks anticipated up to 38.66 seconds ahead.

Conclusion: Pro2Guard effectively balances safety and task success, offering a statistically reliable and proactive solution for LLM agent safety.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities
across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.
However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are
difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as
AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond
only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems
lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution
shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime
enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.
Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it
anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe
states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted
risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity
checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability
while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard
extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and
autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early
on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes
(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to
80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100%
prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to
38.66 seconds ahead.

### [108] [MultiSHAP: A Shapley-Based Framework for Explaining Cross-Modal Interactions in Multimodal AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00576)
*Zhanliang Wang,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiSHAP is a model-agnostic framework using Shapley Interaction Index to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI, applicable to both open- and closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'black-box' nature of multimodal AI models hinders their deployment in high-stakes applications due to lack of interpretability and trustworthiness.

Method: MultiSHAP leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute predictions to fine-grained visual and textual elements, providing instance- and dataset-level explanations.

Result: Experiments show MultiSHAP captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms and offers practical utility in real-world applications.

Conclusion: MultiSHAP provides a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal AI models, extensible beyond two modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that
require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and
language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment
in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are
essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models
remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as
attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal
relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between
modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal
weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability
framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal
predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual
elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to
both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level
explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for
individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input",
and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction
patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across
modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP
faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case
studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond
two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal
AI models.

*Ruiqing Ding,Qianfang Sun,Yongkang Leng,Hui Yin,Xiaojian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM-driven framework improves pre-consultation questionnaire generation from EMRs by extracting key facts, building causal networks, and synthesizing disease knowledge, outperforming direct LLM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM approaches struggle with generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from EMRs due to issues like incomplete information and lack of disease-level synthesis.

Method: The proposed framework has three stages: extracting atomic assertions, constructing personal causal networks, and generating tailored questionnaires.

Result: The method outperforms direct approaches in information coverage, diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances patient information collection by leveraging structured clinical knowledge.

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery.
However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex,
voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct
Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,
particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and
disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage
LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with
timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes
disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;
Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific
questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework
overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical
knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical
experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,
diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its
practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

*Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVR-Eval, a metric for multimedia content quality, and AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system for generating JavaScript code from multimedia assets. The system improves content quality through iterative feedback but struggles with custom assets and feedback utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI struggles with generating complex interactive content like video games, lacking automated evaluation metrics and efficient use of human-like feedback and assets.

Method: Developed AVR-Eval, a relative metric using omni-modal comparisons, and AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system for iterative code generation and improvement.

Result: AVR-Agent outperforms one-shot generation in content quality but fails to leverage custom assets and feedback effectively.

Conclusion: The study highlights a gap in AI's ability to utilize high-quality assets and feedback like humans, pointing to fundamental differences in content creation approaches.

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating
interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.
Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated
evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires
teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets
made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a
multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using
Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,
and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing
evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies
good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a
bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects
relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify
the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback
from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content
A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly
higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,
models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing
no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from
high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not
seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental
differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

### [111] [Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00658)
*Chakattrai Sookkongwaree,Tattep Lakmuang,Chainarong Amornbunchornvej*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC), a novel framework addressing limitations of traditional Granger causality by modeling frequency-dependent causal delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Granger causality methods assume fixed or variable time lags but ignore frequency-band variations in causal interactions, which are crucial in domains like neuroscience.

Method: The authors formalize MB-VLGC, propose a theoretical foundation, and develop an efficient inference pipeline to handle frequency-dependent delays.

Result: Experiments show MB-VLGC outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, proving its broad applicability.

Conclusion: MB-VLGC effectively generalizes traditional approaches, offering improved causality inference for time series data across diverse domains.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many
domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger
causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time
series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag
assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex
systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses
this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time
lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal
interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.
For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region
with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we
formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a
novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling
frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,
demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference
pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time
series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining XAI and generative AI for personalized, multimodal explanations in adaptive learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and user-centricity in AI-driven adaptive learning systems.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework integrating XAI, generative AI, and user personalisation for dynamic, tailored explanations.

Result: Redefines explainability as a user-centred communication process, addressing accuracy, fairness, and personalisation.

Conclusion: Aims to enhance transparency and user experience in AI-driven education through explainable AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping
education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of
these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions
are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but
neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework
that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user
personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to
user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process
tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,
key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,
fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that
enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a user-segmented, context-aware visual explanation system for AI recommendations in social media, adapting explanation style and granularity to user needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI recommendations lack explainability aligned with user-specific needs, reducing their value.

Method: A visual explanation system with diverse methods, tailored to user segments (experts vs. lay users) and contexts.

Result: The framework is the first to jointly adapt explanation style and granularity in a single pipeline.

Conclusion: A pilot study with 30 users will validate the system's impact on decision-making and trust.

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI
recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not
understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in
social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this
vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer
by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The
proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing
explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed
version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the
first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity
(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will
validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

*Tom Or,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large pre-trained multi-modal models for universal fake detection, achieving state-of-the-art results across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious use of synthetic media necessitates robust fake detectors, as existing methods generalize poorly across generative models and data domains.

Method: Leverages latent codes of pre-trained multi-modal models to discriminate real from fake content, training linear classifiers on these features.

Result: Achieves superior or comparable performance to baselines in audio and image fake detection, with efficiency and few-shot effectiveness.

Conclusion: Pre-trained multi-modal models enable universal fake detection, offering computational efficiency and strong performance across domains.

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains,
including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious
users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating
deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is
pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the
majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and
fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family
of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative
classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of
large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.
Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures
information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we
demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve
state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining
computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot
settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,
achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' performance in solving physics problems, introduces a multi-agent framework for improvement, and presents a new benchmark, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}$, with 19,609 problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the capability of LLMs in solving physics problems, addressing gaps in natural language reasoning.

Method: Uses inference-time techniques, multi-agent verification, and comparative analysis to improve LLM performance.

Result: Significant improvements in solving initially poorly performed problems using the multi-agent framework.

Conclusion: The study advances LLM applications in physics problem-solving and introduces a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at

### [116] [Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086)
*Kelly Kendro,Jeffrey Maloney,Scott Jarvis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated texts differ significantly from human-written ones in lexical diversity, with newer models like ChatGPT-4.5 showing less human-like patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how human-like LLM-generated texts are, focusing on lexical diversity.

Method: Compared lexical diversity in texts from four ChatGPT models and human writers (L1/L2 English) across six dimensions using statistical analyses.

Result: LLM texts differed significantly from human texts, with newer models (ChatGPT-4.5) being less human-like. Human writers showed no subgroup differences.

Conclusion: LLMs do not produce human-like lexical diversity, and newer models are less human-like, impacting language pedagogy.

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper calls for greater theorizing of methods in computational humanities to improve clarity and maturity, framing modeling as translation between cultural and computational domains. It highlights the need for theoretical articulation to avoid errors and ensure transparency, introducing 'semiotic complexity' to critique current practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theorizing in computational humanities, which leads to translation errors and interpretive opacity, hindering the field's maturation.

Method: The paper frames modeling as translation work, introduces 'semiotic complexity' to critique current practices, and identifies errors in treating complex data as simple.

Result: The result is a critique of dominant modeling practices, especially in evaluation, for oversimplifying semiotically complex data, and recommendations for better epistemological accounting.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for theoretical rigor in computational humanities to avoid translation errors and improve interpretive transparency, offering practical recommendations.

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues in evaluating model factuality.

Method: Developed FACTORY using a model-in-the-loop approach with human refinement, featuring challenging, fact-seeking prompts.

Result: 40% of claims in SOTA model responses were non-factual, compared to 10% in other datasets.

Conclusion: FACTORY is a reliable, challenging benchmark, highlighting the need for models to reason across long-tailed facts.

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

TL;DR: Neural semantic parsers excel in general tasks but struggle with context-sensitive phenomena like verb phrase ellipsis, despite high overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capability of neural semantic parsers in handling strongly context-sensitive linguistic phenomena, specifically verb phrase ellipsis.

Method: Constructed a corpus of 120 ellipsis cases with resolved meaning representations and tested various neural semantic parsers.

Result: Parsers performed poorly on ellipsis cases despite high scores on standard tests.

Conclusion: Neural semantic parsers are inadequate for context-sensitive phenomena like ellipsis, highlighting a need for improved methods like data augmentation.

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of LLMs and the complexity in selecting the optimal model due to licensing and hardware constraints.

Method: Creation of a comparative list of LLMs, focusing on features like release year, licensing, and hardware requirements, published on GitLab for continuous updates.

Result: A continuously updated resource to navigate the LLM landscape and aid in model selection.

Conclusion: The comparative list simplifies LLM selection, addressing challenges posed by the growing number of models and their diverse requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of table understanding in LLMs and MLLMs, proposing a taxonomy of tabular representations and identifying gaps like limited reasoning tasks, model struggles with complex structures, and poor generalization across formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tables' complex and diverse structures in LLMs and MLLMs lack universal approaches, necessitating specialized methods and highlighting research gaps.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy of tabular input representations and categorizes table understanding tasks.

Result: Identifies gaps: retrieval-focused tasks dominate, models struggle with complex structures, and generalization across formats is limited.

Conclusion: Calls for further research to address the identified gaps in table understanding for LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) on NLP embeddings to analyze and compress them while preserving semantic quality, showing significant dimensionality reduction without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage DWT for analyzing and compressing word and sentence embeddings in NLP, capturing linguistic and semantic properties efficiently.

Method: Empirical application of DWT to embeddings, evaluating its impact on semantic similarity tasks and downstream performance.

Result: DWT reduces embedding dimensionality by 50-93% with minimal performance loss in semantic tasks and improved accuracy in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DWT is effective for embedding compression and analysis, offering potential enhancements for NLP applications.

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

### [123] [Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238)
*Bryce Anderson,Riley Galpin,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs influence word usage in human language, showing a post-2022 increase in LLM-associated words in spoken language, suggesting potential AI-driven language shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs are causing broader changes in human language beyond direct AI-generated text, focusing on unscripted spoken language.

Method: Analyzed a dataset of 22.1 million words from science/tech podcasts, comparing lexical trends before and after ChatGPT's 2022 release.

Result: Found a significant increase in LLM-associated words post-2022, indicating convergence with human word choices, while synonyms remained stable.

Conclusion: The findings suggest AI may be influencing language use, raising ethical concerns about misaligned models shaping human communication and beliefs.

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

*Peixian Li,Yu Tian,Ruiqi Tu,Chengkai Wu,Jingjing Ren,Jingsong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to improve LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning in acute abdominal emergencies, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in medical text tasks but lack reliability in complex clinical diagnoses, prompting the need for enhanced reasoning frameworks.

Method: The framework integrates structured clinical reasoning via Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding, identifies key attention heads, and uses Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning.

Result: The framework boosts diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and reasoning focus by 31.6%, with external validation confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach enhances LLM-based diagnosis by aligning model attention with clinical reasoning, offering a reliable and interpretable AI diagnostic system.

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

*Ammar Ahmed,Sheng Di,Franck Cappello,Zirui Liu,Jingoo Han,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks optimization techniques for LLMs in long-context scenarios, revealing compounded errors in larger models and hidden trade-offs in F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address resource demands and limited context windows in LLMs by evaluating optimization techniques like pruning and quantization.

Method: Systematically benchmarks individual and combined optimization methods, analyzing memory, latency, throughput, and text generation quality.

Result: Naive combinations harm larger models due to compounded errors; F1 scores mask precision-recall trade-offs.

Conclusion: Integrates system-level profiling with task insights to guide efficiency, accuracy, and scalability trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCSEO improves multimodal sentence embeddings by aligning fine-grained object-phrase pairs, outperforming baselines on STS tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-caption pairs in multimodal training often contain noise, reducing embedding quality.

Method: MCSEO uses segmentation and object detection to align object-phrase pairs, optimizing a contrastive learning objective.

Result: MCSEO consistently outperforms baselines on semantic textual similarity tasks.

Conclusion: Precise object-phrase alignment is crucial for effective multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

*Keer Lu,Chong Chen,Bin Cui,Huang Leng,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaPlan and PilotRL improve LLM agent performance by combining global planning with execution, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with long-term planning and generalization, relying on memorized trajectories.

Method: Introduces AdaPlan for strategic guidance and PilotRL for training via progressive reinforcement learning.

Result: PilotRL with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by 3.60% and GPT-4o-mini by 55.78%.

Conclusion: AdaPlan and PilotRL enhance LLM agents' long-horizon decision-making and generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models (SLMs) can rival larger models by using dynamic task vector machines for reasoning, achieving 78.3% accuracy on SimpleQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are limited in knowledge-intensive tasks due to their size. This work aims to enhance their performance by treating reasoning as a dynamic, self-constructed process.

Method: Proposes a dynamic task vector machine, interpreting reasoning between <think> tags as a mechanism for refining task vectors. Uses RLVR for optimization and integrates MCP.

Result: Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM, achieves 78.3% accuracy on SimpleQA, matching larger models like DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: Structured, self-constructed task reasoning enables small models to compete with larger ones.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EdgeInfinite-Instruct optimizes Transformer-based LLMs for edge devices with S-SFT and PTQ, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying LLMs on edge devices due to high computational and memory costs, and limitations of existing methods.

Method: Introduces Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) and fine-grained PTQ for efficient deployment on edge NPUs.

Result: Improved performance on long-context benchmarks and mobile tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct effectively balances efficiency and performance for edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuangliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why some demonstrations in in-context learning (ICL) are ineffective, attributing it to learned or irrelevant information. It proposes GradS, a gradient-flow-based method for selecting effective demonstrations, showing a 6.8% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work assumes all demonstrations in ICL are effective, but many are not. This paper explores the reasons behind ineffective demonstrations and proposes a solution.

Method: The study uses gradient flow and linear self-attention models to analyze demonstration ineffectiveness. It introduces GradS, a method leveraging gradient flow for demonstration selection.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs and five datasets confirm that demonstration effectiveness disparity grows with model layers. GradS improves performance by 6.8% over baselines.

Conclusion: The paper identifies causes of ineffective demonstrations and validates GradS as an effective solution, enhancing ICL performance.

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: SA-GCS improves UAV VLN by integrating curriculum learning into RL, enhancing training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in RL methods for UAV VLN, such as slow convergence and poor data utilization.

Method: Proposes SA-GCS with a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator (SA-DE) and Gaussian Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust training.

Result: Outperforms baselines on CityNav benchmark, with faster convergence and better generalization.

Conclusion: SA-GCS is robust, scalable, and effective for UAV VLN tasks.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wavelets have proven effective in Image and Signal processing, prompting their application to NLP tasks to capture linguistic properties efficiently.

Method: The study applies DWT to word embeddings for dimensionality reduction and combines DWT with DCT to create a non-parameterized model for sentence compression.

Result: The proposed method yields comparable or superior results to original embeddings in downstream NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Wavelet-based techniques are promising for NLP, offering efficient information consolidation and compression without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaGAN introduces an agent-based framework for GNNs, enabling nodes to autonomously plan actions and retrieve global semantic relationships, addressing limitations of fixed aggregation schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed aggregation in GNNs fails to handle node informativeness imbalance and ignores global semantic relationships, limiting performance.

Method: ReaGAN uses agent-based nodes with autonomous planning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access global semantic content.

Result: ReaGAN achieves competitive performance in few-shot settings without fine-tuning, leveraging agentic planning and retrieval.

Conclusion: ReaGAN demonstrates the effectiveness of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in enhancing graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator to aggregate multiple LLM judges' knowledge into one model, reducing computational costs while maintaining evaluation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge methods suffer from biases and high computational costs, necessitating a more efficient and reliable evaluation approach.

Method: Aggregates preference knowledge from multiple LLM judges into a single model to capture collective wisdom efficiently.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on seven benchmarks, demonstrating efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective and reliable solution for dialogue quality assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

*Yixuan Tang,Jincheng Wang,Anthony K. H. Tung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task of half-truth detection and proposes a benchmark (PolitiFact-Hidden) and a framework (TRACER) to address omission-based misinformation in fact verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fact verification systems fail to detect half-truths‚Äîclaims that are factually correct but misleading due to omitted context.

Method: The authors propose TRACER, a modular framework that aligns evidence, infers intent, and estimates the impact of hidden content.

Result: TRACER improves performance, boosting Half-True classification F1 by up to 16 points.

Conclusion: Modeling omissions is crucial for trustworthy fact verification, and TRACER can enhance existing pipelines.

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flat-LoRA and EFlat-LoRA to explore the connection between sharpness and generalization in LoRA, achieving better performance than LoRA and full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little research exists on the correlation between expressive and generalization abilities in LoRA, and the lack of tools to explore sharpness for LoRA motivated this work.

Method: The authors propose Flat-LoRA and EFlat-LoRA, transferring perturbations from the full parameter space to the low-rank subspace to seek flat minima.

Result: EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning on tasks like GLUE and vision-language models, showing performance improvements of up to 1.5%.

Conclusion: The study confirms that LoRA's generalization is linked to sharpness, a factor overlooked by prior methods, and demonstrates the effectiveness of Flat-LoRA and EFlat-LoRA.

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of

### [138] [The Prosody of Emojis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00537)
*Giulio Zhou,Tsz Kin Lam,Alexandra Birch,Barry Haddow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how emojis influence prosody in speech and how listeners interpret prosodic cues to infer emoji meanings, using empirical data from production and perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of emojis as visual surrogates for prosodic features in text-based communication and their impact on spoken prosody.

Method: Analysis of human speech data collected through structured but open-ended production and perception tasks, linking prosody and emoji directly.

Result: Speakers adapt prosody based on emoji cues; listeners can often identify intended emojis from prosodic variation alone; greater semantic differences between emojis lead to increased prosodic divergence.

Conclusion: Emojis serve as meaningful carriers of prosodic intent, highlighting their communicative role in digitally mediated contexts.

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

*Joonas Tapaninaho,Mourad Oussala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaPaformer, a variant of decoder-only transformers, to reduce training time and parameters while improving performance by training parallel paths individually and combining them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models require excessive computation and time for training, even smaller variants like SLMs. The goal is to reduce training time from days/weeks to hours.

Method: Introduces PaPaformer, a decoder-only transformer with parallel paths trained individually on diverse data and combined into a larger model.

Result: Reduces total parameters and training time while increasing performance. Allows customization of paths for specific tasks.

Conclusion: PaPaformer offers a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional transformer training, enabling faster development and task-specific adaptations.

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

### [140] [SynAdapt: Learning Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models via Synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00574)
*Jianwei Wang,Ziming Wu,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynAdapt improves reasoning efficiency by generating synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) for precise alignment and integrates a difficulty classifier to enhance performance on hard questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CCoT methods suffer from inefficiencies like indirect fine-tuning and inconsistent targets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SynAdapt generates synthetic CCoT for alignment and uses a difficulty classifier to identify hard questions, prompting adaptive re-thinking.

Result: Achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off across benchmarks of varying difficulty.

Conclusion: SynAdapt effectively addresses limitations of current CCoT methods, enhancing reasoning performance and efficiency.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

*Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda,Musa Izzanardi Wijanarko,Lucky Susanto,Khumaisa Nur'aini,Derry Wijaya,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NusaAksara is a new benchmark for Indonesian languages, including original scripts, covering text and image tasks. It highlights the poor performance of current NLP models on local scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most NLP progress in Indonesia uses romanized text, neglecting original scripts. NusaAksara aims to address this gap.

Method: Human experts construct a dataset of 8 scripts across 7 languages, including low-resource ones. Tasks include image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and language identification.

Result: Current NLP models (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, PP-OCR) perform poorly on local scripts, often near-zero.

Conclusion: NusaAksara exposes the limitations of existing NLP technologies for Indonesian scripts, urging further research.

Abstract: Indonesia is rich in languages and scripts. However, most NLP progress has
been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel
public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts.
Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse
tasks such as image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and
language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through
rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including
low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although
unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We
benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o,
Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and
show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with
many achieving near-zero performance.

### [142] [A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00600)
*Mingruo Yuan,Shuyi Zhang,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRUX is a framework for context-aware confidence estimation in LLMs, improving trustworthiness by integrating context faithfulness and consistency via novel metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs ignore context relevance, which is critical for evaluating output quality, especially with background knowledge.

Method: CRUX uses two metrics: contextual entropy reduction (for data uncertainty) and unified consistency examination (for model uncertainty).

Result: CRUX outperforms baselines on benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG), achieving the highest AUROC.

Conclusion: CRUX enhances confidence estimation in LLMs by addressing context relevance, making it reliable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

### [143] [GHTM: A Graph based Hybrid Topic Modeling Approach in Low-Resource Bengali Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00605)
*Farhana Haque,Md. Abdur Rahman,Sumon Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model, GHTM, is proposed for Bengali topic modeling, outperforming traditional and contemporary methods in coherence and diversity. A new Bengali dataset, NCTBText, is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topic modeling is understudied in Bengali due to its complexity and lack of resources. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: GHTM uses GCN to create semantic embeddings from document vectors, decomposed via NMF for topic representation. It is compared against LDA, LSA, NMF, BERTopic, and Top2Vec on Bengali datasets.

Result: GHTM outperforms other models in topic coherence and diversity. The NCTBText dataset enriches Bengali corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed GHTM model is effective for Bengali topic modeling, and the new dataset diversifies available resources.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

*Lennart Meincke,Ethan Mollick,Lilach Mollick,Dan Shapiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tipping or threatening AI models has no significant effect on benchmark performance, though prompt variations can impact individual question results unpredictably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test common beliefs about improving AI performance through tipping or threatening models, as endorsed by industry leaders.

Method: Empirical testing on GPQA and MMLU-Pro benchmarks to evaluate the effects of tipping and threatening prompts.

Result: No significant overall impact from tipping or threatening, but prompt variations affect individual question performance unpredictably.

Conclusion: Simple prompting variations like tipping or threatening are less effective than assumed, especially for difficult problems, though they can vary results per question.

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

### [145] [DACTYL: Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00619)
*Shantanu Thorat,Andrew Caines*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DACTYL, a dataset for AIG text detection focusing on one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts, revealing vulnerabilities in existing detectors. It compares BCE and DXO optimization for classifiers, with DXO showing better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIG text detectors lack robustness in real-world settings, especially for one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts.

Method: Created DACTYL dataset, trained classifiers using BCE and DXO optimization, and evaluated performance on test and OOD datasets.

Result: DXO classifiers outperformed BCE-trained ones on OOD texts, showing better generalization. Existing detectors struggled with DACTYL.

Conclusion: DXO optimization improves generalization for AIG text detection, highlighting areas for detector improvement.

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock
deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay
dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by
50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our
results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to
the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG
text detectors.

*Wenxuan Wang,Zizhan Ma,Meidan Ding,Shiyi Zheng,Shengyuan Liu,Jie Liu,Jiaming Ji,Wenting Chen,Xiang Li,Linlin Shen,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical reasoning, proposing a taxonomy of techniques and analyzing their applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in LLMs' ability for systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning in clinical practice drives the need for specialized medical reasoning models.

Method: The study conducts a systematic review of 60 seminal studies (2022-2025), categorizing reasoning enhancement techniques into training-time and test-time strategies, and evaluating their applications across data modalities and clinical tasks.

Result: The review highlights key techniques, benchmarks, and applications, while identifying challenges like the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Future directions focus on developing efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 19 new evaluation datasets for assessing LLMs in Persian language and Iranian culture, benchmarking 41 models to address gaps in non-Western linguistic and cultural evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks are primarily English-centric and lack evaluation resources for non-Western languages and cultures, particularly Persian and Iranian contexts.

Method: The study created 19 datasets covering Iranian law, Persian grammar, idioms, and university exams, then evaluated 41 LLMs using these datasets.

Result: The benchmarking revealed performance gaps in LLMs for Persian language and Iranian cultural contexts, highlighting the need for more diverse evaluation resources.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the lack of evaluation tools for non-Western languages and cultures, advocating for more inclusive LLM assessments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

*Gleb Schmidt,Johannes R√∂misch,Mariia Halchynska,Svetlana Gorovaia,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Sequential Sentence Pair Classifier (SSPC) for fine-grained style change detection in documents, leveraging a pre-trained language model and BiLSTM to outperform baselines on PAN-2025 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Style change detection is a key challenge in authorship analysis, especially at the sentence level, as addressed in the PAN 2025 shared task.

Method: The method uses a pre-trained language model for sentence representations, contextualizes them with a BiLSTM, and predicts style changes via a multi-layer perceptron on adjacent sentences.

Result: The model achieves strong macro-F1 scores (0.923, 0.828, 0.724) on EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD datasets, outperforming baselines including a zero-shot approach.

Conclusion: The SSPC approach effectively addresses the challenge of detecting style changes in short, stylistically shallow sentences, demonstrating robust performance on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

TL;DR: TraceRetriever improves legal precedent retrieval by focusing on rhetorically significant segments, combining BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models for scalable and reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods, necessitating a system that works with partial case information.

Method: The pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, using Reciprocal Rank Fusion for combining results and a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier for rhetorical annotations.

Result: Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, TraceRetriever effectively addresses document volume challenges and aligns with practical search constraints.

Conclusion: TraceRetriever provides a scalable and reliable foundation for legal precedent retrieval, enhancing research when only partial case knowledge is available.

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong zero-shot performance in sentence-level style change detection, outperforming PAN baselines and demonstrating sensitivity to stylistic signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs on the challenging task of sentence-level style change detection.

Method: Benchmarked four LLMs on PAN 2024 and 2025 datasets for multi-author writing style analysis.

Result: LLMs are sensitive to stylistic variations, outperform PAN baselines, and may rely more on stylistic signals than content.

Conclusion: LLMs set a high baseline for style change detection, highlighting their sensitivity to stylistic cues over semantics.

Abstract: This article explores the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) on one of the most challenging tasks in authorship
analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

TL;DR: NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, enhances Legal Judgment Prediction in India by integrating case facts, statutes, and precedents, improving accuracy and explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LJP methods in India ignore statutory provisions and precedents, key in common law systems. NyayaRAG addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes NyayaRAG, a RAG framework combining case facts, legal statutes, and retrieved precedents, evaluated using lexical, semantic, and LLM-based metrics.

Result: Augmenting inputs with legal knowledge boosts predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Conclusion: NyayaRAG effectively improves LJP by leveraging structured legal inputs, offering a tailored solution for the Indian legal system.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

TL;DR: DAMR is a novel KGQA framework combining symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation, outperforming existing methods by integrating MCTS, LLM-based planning, and a lightweight Transformer scorer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static path extraction and high computational costs in current KGQA methods by proposing a dynamic, context-aware approach.

Method: Uses MCTS guided by an LLM planner to reduce search space and a Transformer-based scorer for context-aware path evaluation. Includes dynamic pseudo-path refinement for training.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple KGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAMR offers an efficient, adaptable solution for KGQA by combining symbolic search with dynamic evaluation and continuous learning.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To investigate if LLMs can reason about training data and infer explanations (out-of-context abduction).

Method: Train LLMs on fictitious chatbot names and behaviors, then test their ability to infer names and mimic behaviors without dialogue examples.

Result: GPT 4o correctly inferred chatbot names and mimicked behaviors, indicating situational awareness.

Conclusion: LLMs can reason about training data, with implications for AI safety and situational awareness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

*Sarah Mercer,Daniel P. Martin,Phil Swatton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4-powered generative agents as substitutes for human participants in social science research, specifically in replicating the HEXACO personality inventory. Results show partial alignment with human data, consistency within GPT-4, and model-specific biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the validity of persona-based generative agents in representing human populations for social science research.

Method: Recreated the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 agents, conducting factor analysis, and comparing results to human data.

Result: 1) Partial alignment with HEXACO framework. 2) Consistent personality dimensions within GPT-4. 3) Model-specific biases in personality profiling.

Conclusion: Generative agents show promise but have limitations. The study offers guidance for designing representative agent personas in social science research.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agentic RAG framework for radiology QA, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing hallucinations, especially in mid-sized LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems for radiology QA rely on single-step retrieval, limiting complex clinical reasoning.

Method: An agentic RAG framework enables LLMs to decompose questions, iteratively retrieve evidence, and synthesize responses, evaluated on 24 LLMs using expert-curated datasets.

Result: Agentic retrieval improved diagnostic accuracy (73% vs. 64%), reduced hallucinations (9.4%), and aided factual grounding, with mid-sized models showing the greatest gains.

Conclusion: Agentic frameworks enhance factuality and accuracy in radiology QA, particularly for mid-sized LLMs, suggesting clinical utility.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

*Robin Armingaud,Romaric Besan√ßon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation extraction, outperforms state-of-the-art models in few-shot settings on Re-DocRED, building on GLiNER's compact design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored performance of current RE models in zero-shot/few-shot settings and leverage GLiNER's success in compact NER for relation extraction.

Method: Introduces GLiDRE, a model inspired by GLiNER, and benchmarks it against state-of-the-art models on Re-DocRED.

Result: GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: GLiDRE is effective for document-level relation extraction, especially in few-shot settings, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to
the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

### [157] [MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00760)
*Qiyao Xue,Yuchen Dou,Ryan Shi,Xiang Lorraine Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMBERT, a BERT-based multimodal framework, improves hate speech detection in Chinese by integrating text, speech, and visual data using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture and a progressive training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection in Chinese is challenging due to cloaking techniques and limited focus on multimodal approaches in existing research.

Method: Proposes MMBERT, combining textual, speech, and visual modalities via MoE, with a three-stage training paradigm, modality-specific experts, shared self-attention, and expert allocation.

Result: MMBERT outperforms fine-tuned BERT models, LLMs, and in-context learning approaches on Chinese hate speech datasets.

Conclusion: MMBERT demonstrates superior performance in detecting hate speech in Chinese, addressing gaps in multimodal research and adversarial evasion.

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISGENDERED+, an updated benchmark to evaluate LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, showing improvements in binary and gender-neutral pronouns but gaps in neopronouns and reverse inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness and inclusivity in LLMs, particularly in pronoun usage, as prior benchmarks like MISGENDERED were outdated and limited.

Method: Extended the MISGENDERED benchmark to MISGENDERED+ and evaluated five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, Qwen2.5) across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference tasks.

Result: Notable improvements in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy, but inconsistent performance on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning and suggests future research directions for more inclusive AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future
inclusive AI research.

### [160] [Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819)
*Jinsong Li,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAEDAL introduces a dynamic adaptive length expansion strategy for Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs), eliminating the need for static predefined generation lengths and improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static length constraint in DLLMs causes inefficiency and performance issues, either underperforming on complex tasks or wasting resources on excessive lengths.

Method: DAEDAL uses latent signals in DLLMs to dynamically adjust generation length in two phases: coarse expansion before denoising and targeted expansion during denoising.

Result: DAEDAL matches or outperforms fixed-length baselines while improving computational efficiency by optimizing token usage.

Conclusion: DAEDAL resolves DLLMs' static length limitation, enhancing their practicality and bridging the gap with Autoregressive models.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

*Tong Nie,Jian Sun,Wei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleSTF, a scalable spatiotemporal Transformer with linear complexity, inspired by physical laws, to improve efficiency and efficacy in predicting urban system dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models like graph neural networks struggle with the trade-off between efficacy and efficiency in large-scale urban networks, necessitating a more scalable and interpretable solution.

Method: The authors propose a neural diffusion scheme using Transformer-like structures with low-dimensional embeddings to align with fundamental principles and reduce redundancy.

Result: ScaleSTF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and scalability in large-scale urban systems (traffic flow, solar power, smart meters).

Conclusion: The work offers a new perspective on dynamics prediction in urban networks, balancing interpretability, scalability, and performance.

Abstract: Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and
services, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems
often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by
sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering
contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal
dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have
shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to
computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still
require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by
drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that
align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By
understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled
interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures
whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed
scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is
validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and
smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability.
Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in
large-scale urban networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework (LSTM-Transformer) for measuring HRGC profiles to address safety risks from hump crossings, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hump crossings pose safety risks, and traditional measurement methods are costly and disruptive. The study aims to develop a cost-effective, efficient solution.

Method: A hybrid deep learning framework (LSTM-Transformer) was developed using IMU/GPS data and ground truth from a walking profiler. Three models were tested.

Result: Models 2 (LSTM-Transformer sequential) and 3 (LSTM-Transformer parallel) outperformed others, enabling accurate 2D/3D HRGC profile generation.

Conclusion: The deep learning models show promise for improving HRGC safety by providing rapid, accurate assessments of hang-up susceptibility.

Abstract: Hump crossings, or high-profile Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs), pose
safety risks to highway vehicles due to potential hang-ups. These crossings
typically result from post-construction railway track maintenance activities or
non-compliance with design guidelines for HRGC vertical alignments.
Conventional methods for measuring HRGC profiles are costly, time-consuming,
traffic-disruptive, and present safety challenges. To address these issues,
this research employed advanced, cost-effective techniques and innovative
modeling approaches for HRGC profile measurement. A novel hybrid deep learning
framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures
was developed by utilizing instrumentation and ground truth data.
Instrumentation data were gathered using a highway testing vehicle equipped
with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS)
sensors, while ground truth data were obtained via an industrial-standard
walking profiler. Field data was collected at the Red Rock Railroad Corridor in
Oklahoma. Three advanced deep learning models Transformer-LSTM sequential
(model 1), LSTM-Transformer sequential (model 2), and LSTM-Transformer parallel
(model 3) were evaluated to identify the most efficient architecture. Models 2
and 3 outperformed the others and were deployed to generate 2D/3D HRGC
profiles. The deep learning models demonstrated significant potential to
enhance highway and railroad safety by enabling rapid and accurate assessment
of HRGC hang-up susceptibility.

TL;DR: The paper combines Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in Germany, outperforming DNN and LEAR models in multi-criteria evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve electricity price prediction by integrating regime detection and localized modeling for better operational utility.

Method: Uses DS-HDP-HMM for regime detection and CNPs for localized price trajectory modeling, with regime-weighted predictions.

Result: R-NP outperforms DNN and LEAR in multi-criteria evaluations, emerging as the most balanced solution for 2021-2023.

Conclusion: R-NP is the preferred model for electricity price prediction due to its balanced performance across multiple criteria.

Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural
processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our
methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky
hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to
daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an
independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized
mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with
final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We
rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated
auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse
battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk
management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility
assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior
absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in
specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy
doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as
a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified
LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model
emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.

TL;DR: DevFT introduces a resource-efficient federated fine-tuning method for LLMs, inspired by cognitive development, achieving faster convergence and lower overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of federated fine-tuning for LLMs on edge devices while preserving data privacy.

Method: Decomposes fine-tuning into developmental stages, transferring knowledge between submodels with increasing capacity, and uses layer grouping/fusion for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 4.59√ó faster convergence, 10.67√ó lower communication overhead, and 9.07% performance improvement.

Conclusion: DevFT is a scalable, efficient approach compatible with existing methods, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to
downstream tasks while preserving data privacy, but its resource-intensive
nature limits deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce
Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT), a resource-efficient approach inspired
by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a
compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental
stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge
from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized
initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and
accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually
constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills.
To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces
deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to
distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence,
10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average
performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing
approaches.

*Nhut Truong,Uri Hasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Topographic neural networks with Weight Similarity (WS) constraints outperform Activation Similarity (AS) and standard CNNs in robustness, input sensitivity, and functional localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare the impact of different topographic constraints (WS and AS) on neural network performance and representation.

Method: Train topographic CNNs with WS and AS constraints, then evaluate on classification accuracy, robustness, and spatial organization of representations.

Result: WS networks showed better noise robustness, higher input sensitivity, and stronger functional localization compared to AS and standard CNNs.

Conclusion: Weight-based spatial constraints (WS) enhance robustness and functional organization in neural networks, influencing feature learning and representational geometry.

Abstract: Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the
spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in
neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different
impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such
different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end,
here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two
spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to
develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which
enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on
classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input
degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared
to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved
robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)
greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)
stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations
positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in
orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,
indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational
geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training,
WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic
CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can
shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired
models.

*Ruo Yu Tao,Kaicheng Guo,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces POBAX, a benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms under partial observability, emphasizing diverse forms of observability and memory improvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for partial observability are limited and fail to represent real-world complexities, necessitating a more comprehensive framework.

Method: The authors propose guidelines for benchmarking and introduce POBAX, a library with diverse environments (e.g., localization, visual control) and memory-improvable tasks.

Result: POBAX provides scalable, GPU-friendly environments and shows that tasks require hard-to-learn memory functions, offering clear signals for research.

Conclusion: POBAX serves as a robust benchmark for advancing reinforcement learning under partial observability, with practical tools for evaluation.

Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for
general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to
mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to
gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only
evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature
masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of
partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown
opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two
key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to
ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the
performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors
roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where
performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with
partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice
guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial
observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable
Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present
in various environments and select representative environments for our
benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,
games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory
improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete
signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended
hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box
evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for
GPU-scalable experimentation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriP-LLM is a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework for time-series data, leveraging a tri-branch design and a frozen pretrained LLM to outperform state-of-the-art methods with lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of IoT and smart manufacturing has increased the complexity of time-series data, exposing limitations of traditional statistical methods. The success of LLMs in multimodal tasks inspired this work.

Method: TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features via a tri-branch design (Patching, Selection, Global) and processes patch-wise tokens with a frozen LLM. A lightweight decoder reconstructs inputs for anomaly scoring.

Result: TriP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, shows strong detection capabilities, and reduces memory consumption compared to CI-based LLM approaches.

Conclusion: TriP-LLM is effective for time-series anomaly detection, leveraging LLMs efficiently while being memory-friendly. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of
application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of
Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically
increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the
limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high
heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of
large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision
domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A
Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly
Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features
through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input
time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,
pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from
which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public
benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation
metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to
ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating
strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,
we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.
Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch
processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it
more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model
checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

### [168] [Evaluating COVID 19 Feature Contributions to Bitcoin Return Forecasting: Methodology Based on LightGBM and Genetic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00078)
*Imen Mahmoud,Andrei Velichko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a LightGBM-GA framework to assess COVID-19 indicators' impact on Bitcoin return prediction, finding significant accuracy improvements, especially with vaccination data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if pandemic-related health data enhances Bitcoin return prediction accuracy, addressing market uncertainty during crises.

Method: Integrates LightGBM regression and GA optimization, using COVID-19 metrics (vaccination, hospitalizations, testing) and Bitcoin returns. Performance is evaluated via R2, RMSE, MAE, and PFI analysis.

Result: COVID-19 indicators significantly improved prediction (40% R2 increase, 2% RMSE reduction). Vaccination metrics were key predictors.

Conclusion: The framework enhances financial analytics by incorporating public health data, aiding investors and policymakers during crises.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM
regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically
evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return
prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns
but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data
significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising
daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates,
hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models,
trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31
independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics
(R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and
Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified
individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators
significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme
market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly
significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics,
especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as
dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial
analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and
policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during
systemic crises.

*Ashkan Shakarami,Yousef Yeganeh,Azade Farshad,Lorenzo Nicole,Stefano Ghidoni,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stress-Aware Learning (SAL) introduces a resilient neural training paradigm using adaptive noise to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by structural fatigue in materials science, SAL aims to address stagnation in training by dynamically adjusting optimization behavior.

Method: Proposes the Plastic Deformation Optimizer, which injects adaptive noise into model parameters based on stress signals indicating training difficulty.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness and generalization across multiple architectures, optimizers, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAL effectively escapes sharp minima, converging toward flatter, more generalizable regions with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training
paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization
behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain
dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic)
Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To
instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a
stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters
whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and
accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model
to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions
of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers,
and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization
with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StackLiverNet, an interpretable stacked ensemble model, addresses issues in liver disease classification with high accuracy (99.89%), interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for liver disease classification suffer from misclassification, poor interpretability, and computational inefficiency.

Method: Uses advanced preprocessing, feature selection, random undersampling, and a LightGBM meta-model for ensemble learning.

Result: Achieves 99.89% accuracy, 0.9974 Cohen Kappa, 0.9993 AUC, and fast training/inference times.

Conclusion: StackLiverNet is robust, interpretable, and clinically viable for liver disease detection.

Abstract: Liver diseases are a serious health concern in the world, which requires
precise and timely diagnosis to enhance the survival chances of patients. The
current literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning
models to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high
misclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational
expense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these
drawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked
ensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses
advanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model
robustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal
with class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an
ensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose
complementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided
model demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%,
Cohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and
efficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice
(training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate
transparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high
concentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important
observations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their
global contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most
influential features through sensitivity analysis.

*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured reformulation of neural network layer transformations to enhance stability and interpretability without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contemporary neural networks lack structural safeguards for stable learning and interpretable behavior, prompting the need for a more disciplined approach.

Method: Decomposes layer transformations into structured linear operators and residual corrective components to improve signal propagation and training dynamics.

Result: Models with structured transformations show better gradient conditioning, reduced sensitivity to perturbations, and layer-wise robustness across scales and training regimes.

Conclusion: The work lays the foundation for more stable and transparent neural architectures, balancing expressive power with interpretability.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, contemporary neural networks often lack
structural safeguards that promote stable learning and interpretable behavior.
In this work, we introduce a reformulation of layer-level transformations that
departs from the standard unconstrained affine paradigm. Each transformation is
decomposed into a structured linear operator and a residual corrective
component, enabling more disciplined signal propagation and improved training
dynamics. Our formulation encourages internal consistency and supports stable
information flow across depth, while remaining fully compatible with standard
learning objectives and backpropagation. Through a series of synthetic and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that models constructed with these
structured transformations exhibit improved gradient conditioning, reduced
sensitivity to perturbations, and layer-wise robustness. We further show that
these benefits persist across architectural scales and training regimes. This
study serves as a foundation for a more principled class of neural
architectures that prioritize stability and transparency-offering new tools for
reasoning about learning behavior without sacrificing expressive power.

*Christopher Harvey,Sumaiya Shomaji,Zijun Yao,Amit Noheria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores feature generation methods for ECG signals using PCA and Autoencoders, introducing three VAE variants to simplify data and improve prediction tasks. The A beta-VAE excels in signal reconstruction, while SAE encodings enhance LVEF prediction with reduced computational needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are complex and variable, making deep learning challenging with small datasets. The study aims to simplify ECG data and improve predictive performance using feature generation methods.

Method: Three novel VAE variants (SAE, A beta-VAE, C beta-VAE) are introduced and compared using PCA and Autoencoders. Their effectiveness is tested with LGBM for signal reconstruction and LVEF prediction.

Result: A beta-VAE achieved superior signal reconstruction (MAE: 15.7+/-3.2 muV). SAE encodings improved LVEF prediction (AUROC: 0.901), nearly matching CNN performance with fewer resources.

Conclusion: VAE encodings simplify ECG data and enable effective deep learning with limited labeled data, offering a practical solution for small-scale training datasets.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for
cardiac assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the
high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a
60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep
learning models, especially when only small training datasets are available.
This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods
from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed
beta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their
effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream
prediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE
achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE)
to 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE
encodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the
prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an
holdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
of 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909
AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less
computational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline
avoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less
data. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective
in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep
learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.

*Mohit Gupta,Debjit Bhowmick,Rhys Newbury,Meead Saberi,Shirui Pan,Ben Beck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INSPIRE-GNN, a hybrid GNN framework with RL, improves bicycling volume estimation in data-sparse cities by optimizing sensor placement, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High data sparsity in bicycling volume estimation due to limited sensor coverage in cities necessitates an innovative solution.

Method: Combines GCN and GAT with a DQN-based RL agent for strategic sensor placement and volume estimation.

Result: Outperforms heuristic methods in key metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) and benchmarks against standard ML/DL models.

Conclusion: INSPIRE-GNN offers actionable insights for expanding sensor networks and improving bicycling data accuracy in urban planning.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable
urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges
of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To
address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize
sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in
data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL
agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to
maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network,
comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments
(99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume
estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in
deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms
traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness
centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random
placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our
experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep
learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its
effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable
insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and
maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for
informed transportation planning decisions.

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method interprets weights of fine-tuned LLMs to detect behaviors without needing similar training data, achieving high accuracy in threat detection and model auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods rely on similar data distributions, limiting their ability to detect novel threats like backdoors in LLMs.

Method: Analyzes weight differences between fine-tuned and base models, focusing on top singular vectors to identify new behaviors and monitor activations.

Result: Detects backdoored models with 100% success (1.2% false positives) and unlearned topics with 95.42% accuracy. Also useful for model auditing.

Conclusion: The method effectively monitors and controls fine-tuned LLMs, offering robust detection and auditing capabilities without requiring original training data.

Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often
not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing
interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often
require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant
limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like
backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and
controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,
thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the
unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the
weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to
newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations
along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during
fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger
is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate
below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on
erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to
recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows
potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial
instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover
model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney
prompt generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of transmitting medical data efficiently through noisy, bandwidth-limited channels for timely remote healthcare.

Method: Introduces DiSC-Med with medical-enhanced compression and denoising blocks for bandwidth efficiency and robustness.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance and high bandwidth efficiency in noisy channels, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DiSC-Med shows potential for robust and efficient telehealth applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has driven smart health with
next-generation wireless communication technologies, stimulating exciting
applications in remote diagnosis and intervention. To enable a timely and
effective response for remote healthcare, efficient transmission of medical
data through noisy channels with limited bandwidth emerges as a critical
challenge. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based semantic
communication framework, namely DiSC-Med, for the medical image transmission,
where medical-enhanced compression and denoising blocks are developed for
bandwidth efficiency and robustness, respectively. Unlike conventional
pixel-wise communication framework, our proposed DiSC-Med is able to capture
the key semantic information and achieve superior reconstruction performance
with ultra-high bandwidth efficiency against noisy channels. Extensive
experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the effectiveness of our
framework, demonstrating its potential for robust and efficient telehealth
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for regression tasks, offering flexibility beyond traditional differentiable loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression techniques are limited by predefined, differentiable loss functions, which may not handle asymmetric costs or complex objectives well.

Method: Frames regression as an RL problem, treating predictions as actions and using custom reward signals. The approach involves an Actor-Critic agent enhanced with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity, and positional encoding.

Result: The RL framework successfully solves the regression task and provides greater flexibility in defining objectives.

Conclusion: RL is a viable and flexible alternative for regression, especially for complex or non-differentiable objectives.

Abstract: Standard regression techniques, while powerful, are often constrained by
predefined, differentiable loss functions such as mean squared error. These
functions may not fully capture the desired behavior of a system, especially
when dealing with asymmetric costs or complex, non-differentiable objectives.
In this paper, we explore an alternative paradigm: framing regression as a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We demonstrate this by treating a model's
prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on the
prediction error, and we can leverage powerful RL algorithms to perform
function approximation. Through a progressive case study of learning a noisy
sine wave, we illustrate the development of an Actor-Critic agent, iteratively
enhancing it with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity,
and positional encoding to enable a capable RL agent for this regression task.
Our results show that the RL framework not only successfully solves the
regression problem but also offers enhanced flexibility in defining objectives
and guiding the learning process.

*Adam Block,Cyril Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEMA (Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average) is proposed to mitigate instability in language model fine-tuning by reducing stochasticity and eliminating bias, outperforming EMA and vanilla training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the instability in language model fine-tuning caused by stochasticity and the lag introduced by EMA's bias.

Method: Introduces BEMA, a variant of EMA that corrects bias while retaining variance-reduction benefits, supported by theoretical analysis.

Result: BEMA improves convergence rates and final performance in language model benchmarks compared to EMA and vanilla training.

Conclusion: BEMA is a practical and theoretically grounded solution for stable and efficient fine-tuning of language models.

Abstract: Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning, often caused by the small batch
sizes typically used in this regime, can destabilize training by introducing
large oscillations in generation quality. A popular approach to mitigating this
instability is to take an Exponential moving average (EMA) of weights
throughout training. While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing
training, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in
optimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the
Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical
augmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating
bias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate
provable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training.
Through an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA
leads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over
both EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making
BEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and
efficient fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RecoMind is a simulator-based RL framework for optimizing session-based goals in web-scale recommendation systems, outperforming traditional supervised learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised learning in recommendation systems prioritizes immediate feedback, but RL can optimize longer-term goals like in-session engagement. However, scaling RL is challenging due to large action spaces and engineering complexity.

Method: RecoMind uses existing recommendation models to create a simulation environment and bootstrap RL policies. It integrates with industry pipelines and employs a custom exploration strategy for large action spaces.

Result: Offline simulations and online A/B tests showed RecoMind's RL policy significantly improves in-session satisfaction, increasing videos watched by 15.81% and session depth by 4.71%.

Conclusion: RecoMind provides a scalable and systematic approach to integrating RL into web-scale recommendation systems, effectively optimizing session-based user satisfaction.

Abstract: Existing web-scale recommendation systems commonly use supervised learning
methods that prioritize immediate user feedback. Although reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as
in-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the
extremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we
introduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective
optimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing
recommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap
the RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This
method integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the
training and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a
custom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with
hundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline
simulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform. Both methods
showed that the RL policy trained using RecoMind significantly outperforms
traditional supervised learning recommendation approaches in in-session user
satisfaction. In online A/B tests, the RL policy increased videos watched for
more than 10 seconds by 15.81\% and improved session depth by 4.71\% for
sessions with at least 10 interactions. As a result, RecoMind presents a
systematic and scalable approach for embedding RL into web-scale recommendation
systems, showing great promise for optimizing session-based user satisfaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage framework improves robust classification with noisy labels by leveraging geometry information and reliability estimation, outperforming standard kNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fine-tuning foundation models with noisy data without retraining, inspired by the effectiveness of kNN approaches in noisy settings.

Method: Proposes a two-stage process: reliability estimation and reliability-weighted inference, using NNK neighborhood construction and methods less dependent on distance as noise increases.

Result: Demonstrates improved robustness across noise conditions on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST, surpassing standard kNN and adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances classification robustness in noisy label scenarios by incorporating geometry information and adaptive reliability estimation.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental
for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where
obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we
assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage
framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise
without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good
performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated
by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper,
following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by
reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be
achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our
proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using
the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several
methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local
neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and
DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise
conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent
adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

*Paul Albert,Frederic Z. Zhang,Hemanth Saratchandran,Anton van den Hengel,Ehsan Abbasnejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAdapter, a new PEFT method using Khatri-Rao product, outperforms LoRA in high-rank scenarios while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LoRA's limitations in approximating high-rank matrices, especially in multimodal and large language models.

Method: Introduces KRAdapter, leveraging Khatri-Rao product for high-rank weight updates, tested on models up to 8B parameters.

Result: KRAdapter shows gains on vision-language and large language models, especially in unseen common-sense reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: KRAdapter is a practical, efficient alternative to LoRA for fine-tuning billion-scale models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for
adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted
its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when
applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a
quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a
synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties.
Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively
flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks.
To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the
Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to
produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance
gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large
language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense
reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute
efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune
billion-scale parameter models.

*Jerry Huang,Peng Lu,Qiuhao Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of instruction tuning on confidence calibration in LLMs, identifies calibration degradation, and proposes label smoothing as a solution, addressing its limitations and memory issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how instruction tuning affects confidence calibration in LLMs and finding practical solutions to maintain calibration.

Method: Examines open-sourced LLMs, analyzes calibration degradation, and tests label smoothing. Also designs a kernel to reduce memory footprint in label smoothed loss.

Result: Label smoothing helps maintain calibration but is less effective for large vocabulary LLMs. A custom kernel reduces memory usage without performance loss.

Conclusion: Label smoothing is effective for calibration in SFT, but challenges remain for LV-LLMs. The proposed kernel offers a memory-efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater
opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as
more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following
ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for
reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine
various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation
after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards
label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for
overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing
is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However,
settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in
particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to
stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship
with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and
experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory
footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss
setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory
consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing
solutions for non-smoothed losses.

one million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of
multiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning.
Employing the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation,
we assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance
policies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness,
session completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a
suitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second
attempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the
resulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant
improvements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the
overall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit
(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on
individual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using
causal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across
students and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect
heterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some
actions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often
be too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what
well-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students
already achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems
at scale and implications for future refinements. Today, the teaching policies
optimized by our system support thousands of students daily.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based method for performance-based seismic design, treating it as an inverse problem to directly derive design parameters for specific performance goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies in performance-based seismic design by leveraging explainable machine learning and optimization.

Method: Uses explainable machine learning to map design variables to performance metrics, integrated with a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem.

Result: High accuracy (R2>90%) in surrogate models across diverse building types, with the optimization algorithm identifying optimal member properties.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively combines machine learning and optimization for efficient, accurate seismic design.

Abstract: This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design
as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived
to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine
learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and
performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based
design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation
function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem.
The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel
and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional
properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in
terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models
(e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic
design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the
optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables,
consistent with engineering principles.

*Tianyin Liao,Ziwei Zhang,Yufei Sun,Chunyu Hu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GOODFormer is a Graph Transformer designed to generalize under distribution shifts by capturing invariant graph patterns through three modules: disentangling subgraphs, encoding dynamic subgraphs, and invariant learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers fail under distribution shifts, and invariant learning principles for attention and encodings are underexplored.

Method: GOODFormer uses an entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler, an evolving subgraph encoder, and an invariant learning module to derive generalizable representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show GOODFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GOODFormer effectively generalizes to unseen graphs by capturing invariant relationships, supported by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various
graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing
graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under
distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable
graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially
a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and
structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles
remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph
Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn
generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between
predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three
modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant
subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while
preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving
subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently
capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during
training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph
node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph
representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical
justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under
distribution shifts.

*Yongquan Qu,Matthieu Blanke,Sara Shamekh,Pierre Gentine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PnP-DA is a Plug-and-Play data assimilation method combining gradient-based updates with a pretrained generative prior, outperforming classical variational methods by reducing forecast errors without restrictive Gaussian assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth system modeling faces challenges in capturing multiscale dynamics and minimizing forecast errors, exacerbated by non-Gaussian behavior in chaotic systems. Conventional DA methods assume Gaussian errors, which are often inadequate.

Method: PnP-DA alternates between a gradient-based analysis update using Mahalanobis-distance misfit and a forward pass through a pretrained generative prior via conditional Wasserstein coupling, avoiding backpropagation through the prior's neural network.

Result: Experiments on chaotic testbeds show PnP-DA consistently reduces forecast errors across varying observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Conclusion: PnP-DA effectively mitigates forecast errors by relaxing Gaussian assumptions and leveraging historical data, offering a robust alternative to traditional DA methods.

Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally
efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary
simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system
suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate
these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model
forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error
statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic
dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates
(1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance
misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained
generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional
Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions
and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization
functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the
complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles.
Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy
consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities
and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an embryological approach using UMAP on susceptibility matrices to visualize language model development, revealing new structures like a "spacing fin" and known features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal computational structure of language models and explore the untapped potential of susceptibilities for visualizing network organization.

Method: Applied UMAP to the susceptibility matrix to visualize structural development during training.

Result: Discovered a "body plan" with known features (e.g., induction circuit) and novel structures (e.g., "spacing fin").

Conclusion: Susceptibility analysis can uncover new mechanisms, offering a holistic tool for studying neural network development.

Abstract: Understanding how language models develop their internal computational
structure is a central problem in the science of deep learning. While
susceptibilities, drawn from statistical physics, offer a promising analytical
tool, their full potential for visualizing network organization remains
untapped. In this work, we introduce an embryological approach, applying UMAP
to the susceptibility matrix to visualize the model's structural development
over training. Our visualizations reveal the emergence of a clear ``body
plan,'' charting the formation of known features like the induction circuit and
discovering previously unknown structures, such as a ``spacing fin'' dedicated
to counting space tokens. This work demonstrates that susceptibility analysis
can move beyond validation to uncover novel mechanisms, providing a powerful,
holistic lens for studying the developmental principles of complex neural
networks.

*Qilin Liao,Shuo Yang,Bo Zhao,Ping Luo,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOOD is a novel framework using diffusion models to generate high-quality OOD features and images, improving OOD detection by perturbing ID features near decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing OOD detection by addressing the challenge of extracting effective OOD features outside ID boundaries in latent space.

Method: BOOD learns a text-conditioned latent space, selects boundary-proximate ID features, perturbs them into OOD features, and decodes these into images using diffusion models.

Result: BOOD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing FPR95 by 29.64% and improving AUROC by 7.27% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: BOOD offers an efficient and effective strategy for OOD feature synthesis, enabling clearer ID-OOD distinctions and superior detection performance.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training
data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective
features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains
challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between
classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based
Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD
features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models.
BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset,
selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to
cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features
are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to
previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for
synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions
between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks
demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly,
achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27%
improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

*Yoonhyuk Choi,Jiho Choi,Chong-Kwon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGPC introduces a unified architecture for GNNs using sheaf theory with PAC-Bayes calibration, addressing over-smoothing and improving performance on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-smoothing in GNNs and limitations of existing sheaf-based methods (static structures, lack of guarantees) motivate a robust, scalable solution.

Method: SGPC combines cellular-sheaf message passing with optimal transport, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes regularization for semi-supervised node classification.

Result: SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs on nine benchmarks and provides certified confidence intervals.

Conclusion: SGPC offers a scalable, theoretically grounded solution to over-smoothing with rigorous guarantees and superior performance.

Abstract: Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct
node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often
have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this
problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf
structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based
models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet
fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a
novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified
architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several
mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced
diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised
node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and
demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via
end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine
homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms
state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified
confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

TL;DR: OID-PPO, a novel RL framework, improves residential interior design by integrating expert guidelines and enabling continuous furniture placement, outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residential interior design is complex due to unstructured layouts, high computational demands, and reliance on expertise. Existing methods are either expensive or data-limited.

Method: OID-PPO uses Proximal Policy Optimization with a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous furniture placement, incorporating expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into rewards.

Result: OID-PPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in layout quality and computational efficiency across diverse room shapes and furniture setups.

Conclusion: The framework's success highlights the importance of structured guideline integration and continuous placement, with ablation studies validating individual design constraints.

Abstract: Designing residential interiors strongly impacts occupant satisfaction but
remains challenging due to unstructured spatial layouts, high computational
demands, and reliance on expert knowledge. Existing methods based on
optimization or deep learning are either computationally expensive or
constrained by data scarcity. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often
limit furniture placement to discrete positions and fail to incorporate design
principles adequately. We propose OID-PPO, a novel RL framework for Optimal
Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization, which integrates
expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward
function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and
flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental
dynamics under partial observability. Experiments conducted across diverse room
shapes and furniture configurations demonstrate that OID-PPO significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of layout quality and
computational efficiency. Ablation studies further demonstrate the impact of
structured guideline integration and reveal the distinct contributions of
individual design constraints.

*Lijun Zhang,Wenhao Yang,Guanghui Wang,Wei Jiang,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces universal algorithms with dual adaptivity for online convex optimization, addressing limitations of existing methods by adapting to various function types and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms lack universality, being limited to specific convex functions and requiring prior knowledge, which restricts real-world applicability.

Method: A meta-expert framework is proposed, dynamically creating and aggregating experts via a meta-algorithm with second-order bounds, incorporating sleeping experts for changing environments.

Result: The algorithms minimize adaptive regret for multiple convex function types simultaneously, even allowing function type switches between rounds.

Conclusion: The framework is extended to online composite optimization, offering a universal solution for adaptive regret minimization in composite functions.

Abstract: To deal with changing environments, a new performance measure -- adaptive
regret, defined as the maximum static regret over any interval, was proposed in
online learning. Under the setting of online convex optimization, several
algorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.
However, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only
handle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,
which hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,
which automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially
concave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary
or changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual
adaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and
aggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a
second-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further
incorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing
environments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies
(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to
achieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able
to minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions
simultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.
Moreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,
and develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of
composite functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain experts lack ML expertise but need ML-based analytics, making pipeline development challenging.

Result: The library is demonstrated through real use cases, proving its usability and usefulness.

Conclusion: ExeKGLib bridges the gap for non-ML experts, enabling accessible and executable ML workflows.

Abstract: Nowadays machine learning (ML) practitioners have access to numerous ML
libraries available online. Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines
that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML
libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development
of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML
expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain
experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and
training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper,
we present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface
layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This
is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple
terms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the
transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they
are executable. We show the usability and usefulness of ExeKGLib by presenting
real use cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co-Reward is a self-supervised RL framework using contrastive agreement across analogical questions to improve LLM reasoning, outperforming baselines and even ground-truth rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scaling up dilemma in RLVR and the collapse issue in self-reward methods for LLM reasoning.

Method: Constructs similar questions without labels, synthesizes surrogate labels via rollout voting, and enforces reasoning consistency across analogical inputs.

Result: Achieves superior performance, surpassing ground-truth rewards by up to +6.8% on MATH500 with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Co-Reward effectively mitigates collapse issues and enhances reasoning stability and performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows promise
in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the scaling
up dilemma remains due to the reliance on human annotated labels especially for
complex tasks. Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals
exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the
non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised
learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages
contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward
basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample
(without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a
simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring
the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency
across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping
mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial
solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through
expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior
performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning
benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT)
labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward
on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at

Result: ResE-BiLSTM achieves superior predictive performance over baseline models, validated on 44 cohorts from the Freddie Mac dataset.

Conclusion: The ResE-BiLSTM model is effective for loan default prediction, offering practical value for real-world credit risk management.

Abstract: Prediction of post-loan default is an important task in credit risk
management, and can be addressed by detection of financial anomalies using
machine learning. This study introduces a ResE-BiLSTM model, using a sliding
window technique, and is evaluated on 44 independent cohorts from the extensive
Freddie Mac US mortgage dataset, to improve prediction performance. The
ResE-BiLSTM is compared with five baseline models: Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), BiLSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), across multiple metrics, including
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC. An ablation study was conducted to
evaluate the contribution of individual components in the ResE-BiLSTM
architecture. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the
underlying features the model relied upon for its predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that ResE-BiLSTM achieves superior predictive performance
compared to baseline models, underscoring its practical value and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

*Leonidas Akritidis,Panayiotis Bozanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ctdGAN, a conditional GAN for addressing class imbalance in tabular data by leveraging space partitioning and a novel sampling strategy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in tabular data degrades ML performance. Existing GANs ignore vector subspaces and treat class labels poorly, leading to ineffective data generation.

Method: ctdGAN uses space partitioning to assign cluster labels, a probabilistic sampling strategy, and a new loss function to generate data in subspaces resembling the original distribution.

Result: ctdGAN outperforms on 14 imbalanced datasets, generating high-fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

Conclusion: ctdGAN effectively addresses class imbalance in tabular data by generating realistic samples in the correct subspaces, enhancing ML performance.

Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in
relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms,
tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious
performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the
most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the
under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed
GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the
real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,
the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical
variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less
effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a
conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,
ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input
samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a
novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes
both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to
generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data
distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,
yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature
modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of
ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating
high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLL combines LLMs and GNNs for improved anomaly detection in text-attributed graphs, achieving a 13.37% AP boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAD methods neglect textual modality's potential, relying on shallow embeddings and missing semantic context. LLMs offer strong semantic understanding but struggle with graph structure.

Method: CoLL integrates multi-LLM collaboration for anomaly-relevant context and human-readable rationales, and a GNN with gating to fuse textual and structural features.

Result: CoLL outperforms existing methods, improving AP by 13.37%.

Conclusion: CoLL successfully leverages LLMs and GNNs for TAG anomaly detection, opening new research directions.

Abstract: The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual
information in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for
graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on
designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking
the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often
encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so
that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the
enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have
emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding
and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly
detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural
information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For
high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that
combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary
strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented
generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable
rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped
with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while
preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37%
in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMUCL, an end-to-end method for anomaly detection in text-attributed graphs (TAGs), integrating text and graph data to improve detection accuracy by 11.13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods separate text encoding from anomaly detection, limiting performance. The paper aims to unify these processes for better results.

Method: CMUCL jointly trains text and graph encoders using cross-modal and uni-modal consistency, with an anomaly score estimator based on inconsistency mining.

Result: CMUCL outperforms existing methods by 11.13% in average accuracy (AP).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates text and graph data for anomaly detection, demonstrated by significant performance improvements.

Abstract: The widespread application of graph data in various high-risk scenarios has
increased attention to graph anomaly detection (GAD). Faced with real-world
graphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,
termed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection
pipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual
information into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks
within the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding
process is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph
domain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus
on GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.
How to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast
potential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging
issue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed
graph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both
text and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by
leveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover
potential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score
estimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores.
Considering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on
TAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive
evaluations show that CMUCL significantly advances in text-attributed graph
anomaly detection, delivering an 11.13% increase in average accuracy (AP) over
the suboptimal.

*Sifan Yang,Yuanyu Wan,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback, improving regret bounds by decoupling delays and bandit feedback effects. Two algorithms, DBGD-NF and its extension, achieve better bounds tied to average delay and decoupled effects, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work's regret bound depends on maximum delay, making it sensitive to irregular delays and coupling delays with bandit feedback. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: DBGD-NF uses one-point gradient estimators and all available gradients per round, while its extension employs a blocking update mechanism to decouple delays and bandit feedback.

Result: DBGD-NF achieves an O(n¬Ød¬π/¬≥T¬≤/¬≥) bound (average delay), and its extension achieves O(n(T¬≤/¬≥ + ‚àödT)), matching no-delay bounds when d = O(T¬π/¬≥). Experiments confirm superiority.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve regret bounds by addressing delay sensitivity and coupling effects, with practical validation on structured sparse learning.

Abstract: We investigate the online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in
the bandit setting, where the loss function is $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular
and $\beta$-weakly DR-supermodular. Previous work has established an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(nd^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $n$ is
the dimensionality and $d$ is the maximum delay. However, its regret bound
relies on the maximum delay and is thus sensitive to irregular delays.
Additionally, it couples the effects of delays and bandit feedback as its bound
is the product of the delay term and the $\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ regret bound
in the bandit setting without delayed feedback. In this paper, we develop two
algorithms to address these limitations, respectively. Firstly, we propose a
novel method, namely DBGD-NF, which employs the one-point gradient estimator
and utilizes all the available estimated gradients in each round to update the
decision. It achieves a better $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret
bound, which is relevant to the average delay $\bar{d} =
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T d_t\leq d$. Secondly, we extend DBGD-NF by employing a
blocking update mechanism to decouple the joint effect of the delays and bandit
feedback, which enjoys an $\mathcal{O}(n(T^{2/3} + \sqrt{dT}))$ regret bound.
When $d = \mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$, our regret bound matches the
$\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ bound in the bandit setting without delayed feedback.
Compared to our first $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ bound, it is more
advantageous when the maximum delay $d = o(\bar{d}^{2/3}T^{1/3})$. Finally, we
conduct experiments on structured sparse learning to demonstrate the
superiority of our methods.

### [198] [Phase-Locked SNR Band Selection for Weak Mineral Signal Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00539)
*Judy X Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage framework improves mineral detection in hyperspectral imaging by filtering noisy bands and refining data for better unmixing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak mineral signatures in hyperspectral imaging are often obscured by noise and redundant bands, limiting detection performance.

Method: The framework involves SNR-based band selection, spectral smoothing, KMeans clustering for endmember extraction, and NNLS for abundance unmixing.

Result: The pipeline enhances unmixing accuracy and detects weak mineral zones more effectively.

Conclusion: The two-stage strategy is practical and reproducible for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging offers detailed spectral information for mineral
mapping; however, weak mineral signatures are often masked by noisy and
redundant bands, limiting detection performance. To address this, we propose a
two-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite
mining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
for each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to
discard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing
background noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral
smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection,
and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In
the second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where
KMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed
by non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting
endmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using
cosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our
proposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak
mineral zones. This two-pass strategy demonstrates a practical and reproducible
solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI
applications.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current interpretability definitions as non-actionable and proposes a new, actionable definition for designing interpretable models, including a blueprint and an open-sourced library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability definitions lack practicality for model design, making research ill-posed.

Method: Proposes a new interpretability definition, derives foundational properties, and introduces a blueprint and open-sourced library for interpretable models.

Result: The new definition is actionable, revealing necessary design principles, and a library is provided for practical use.

Conclusion: The work advances interpretable AI by offering a clear, actionable framework and tools for model design.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in
that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable
model design. This makes current interpretability research fundamentally
ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability
that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the
interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it
directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions,
principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing
interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for
designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library
with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

### [200] [Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578)
*Marlen Neubert,Patrick Reiser,Frauke Gr√§ter,Pascal Friederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores machine-learned potentials for simulating hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions in peptides, benchmarking graph neural networks (MACE, SchNet, Allegro) for accuracy in predicting energy surfaces and reaction barriers. MACE outperforms others, enabling large-scale simulations of HAT in biomolecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding HAT reactions in biological processes is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at large scales, which classical methods cannot provide. Machine-learned potentials offer a solution.

Method: Systematic generation of HAT configurations in peptides using semiempirical methods and DFT, followed by benchmarking three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, MACE) for PES and barrier prediction.

Result: MACE achieves the highest accuracy (1.13 kcal/mol MAE) in predicting out-of-distribution DFT barriers, enabling large-scale simulations of HAT in collagen.

Conclusion: The approach advances mechanistic understanding of HAT in peptides and is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, combining ML potentials with active learning for improved simulations.

Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological
processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic
pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to
the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,
neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.
Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy
surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to
generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions
in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.
Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large
datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural
network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT
PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE
consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,
achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT
barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into
large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted
barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in
peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance
trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials
with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is
generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate
simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.

*Thorben Werner,Lars Schmidt-Thieme,Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active Learning (AL) is less efficient than data augmentation (DA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) in low-data scenarios, but combining AL with DA and SSL can still yield performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AL is rarely applied outside its literature due to high computational cost and small performance gains in low-data settings.

Method: The study compares AL, DA, and SSL in low-data scenarios, evaluating their individual and combined impacts.

Result: AL alone provides only 1-4% lift over random sampling, while DA and SSL can achieve up to 60% lift. Combining AL with DA and SSL still improves performance.

Conclusion: AL should be used as a final step after applying DA and SSL to maximize data performance, rather than as a primary solution for missing labels.

Abstract: Even though Active Learning (AL) is widely studied, it is rarely applied in
contexts outside its own scientific literature. We posit that the reason for
this is AL's high computational cost coupled with the comparatively small lifts
it is typically able to generate in scenarios with few labeled points. In this
work we study the impact of different methods to combat this low data scenario,
namely data augmentation (DA), semi-supervised learning (SSL) and AL. We find
that AL is by far the least efficient method of solving the low data problem,
generating a lift of only 1-4\% over random sampling, while DA and SSL methods
can generate up to 60\% lift in combination with random sampling. However, when
AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it surprisingly is still able
to provide improvements. Based on these results, we frame AL not as a method to
combat missing labels, but as the final building block to squeeze the last bits
of performance out of data after appropriate DA and SSL methods as been
applied.

*Mukesh Kumar Sahu,Pinki Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new model (SBSCGM) uses patient similarity graphs and hybrid GNNs to predict ICU patient criticalness, outperforming baselines with an AUC-ROC of 0.94.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to leverage relational EHR data, limiting their predictive accuracy for ICU patient criticalness.

Method: SBSCGM dynamically builds patient similarity graphs using hybrid similarity measures, and HybridGraphMedGNN combines GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT layers for robust predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC 0.94) on MIMIC-III data, with improved precision/recall and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, interpretable solution for ICU risk prediction, aiding clinicians in real-world settings.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU
mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However,
conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to
exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose
a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds
a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN
architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a
continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure
(combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with
analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT)
layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and
global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III
dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$)
outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also
demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism
provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a
scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with
potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.

*Paul Tresson,Pierre Le Coz,Hadrien Tulet,Anthony Malkassian,Maxime R√©jou M√©chain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IAMAP is a QGIS plugin that simplifies deep learning for remote sensing by leveraging self-supervised learning, requiring minimal data and coding skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in remote sensing is often inaccessible due to the need for large datasets, computing resources, and coding expertise.

Method: IAMAP uses self-supervised learning (foundation models) for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and model validation, all within a user-friendly interface.

Result: IAMAP enables non-specialists to use deep learning efficiently without GPUs or extensive datasets.

Conclusion: IAMAP democratizes deep learning in remote sensing, making it practical and energy-efficient.

Abstract: Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial
intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has
largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it
often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation;
(ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we
introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three
challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in
self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature
extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can
often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to
no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps
in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide
range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with
built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced
representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating
and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling
non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent
deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference
datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient
and energy-conscious deep learning methods.

*Xiong Xiong,Zhuo Zhang,Rongchun Hu,Chen Gao,Zichen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SV-SNN introduces a novel neural network framework to solve high-frequency oscillatory PDEs by addressing spectral bias in traditional PINNs, achieving significant accuracy and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with spectral bias, limiting their effectiveness for high-frequency PDEs. SV-SNN aims to overcome this by integrating separation of variables and adaptive spectral methods.

Method: SV-SNN decomposes multivariate functions into univariate products, uses adaptive Fourier spectral features, and employs a theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition.

Result: SV-SNN improves accuracy by 1-3 orders of magnitude, reduces parameters by 90%, and cuts training time by 60% on benchmark problems.

Conclusion: SV-SNN effectively solves spectral bias in neural PDE solving, offering a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a
critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid
mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting
their ability to capture high-frequency solution components. We introduce
Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that
addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with
adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1)
decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products,
enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier
spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency
capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to
quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems
including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and
Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of
magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\%
and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective
solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving. The implementation
will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KFS, a KAN-based adaptive frequency selection architecture for time series forecasting, addressing noise and heterogeneous information issues across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series suffer from noise interference and suboptimal multi-scale representation due to heterogeneous frequency information.

Method: Proposes KFS with FreK module for dominant frequency selection, KAN for pattern representation, and timestamp embedding alignment for temporal synchronization.

Result: KFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: KFS is a simple yet effective solution for multi-scale time series forecasting challenges.

Abstract: Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant
methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series
exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous
information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to
suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency
Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This
framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise
interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which
performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral
domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while
timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across
scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with
aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world
time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance
as a simple yet effective architecture.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning is applied to optimize drone swarm interception, outperforming rule-based methods in defense scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of prioritizing interceptions in low-cost kamikaze drone swarms for modern defense systems.

Method: A reinforcement learning agent is trained in a high-fidelity simulation to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception prioritization.

Result: The reinforcement learning policy achieves lower average damage and higher defensive efficiency compared to a rule-based baseline.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning enhances defense resilience and can be integrated as a strategic layer without replacing existing systems.

Abstract: The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical
challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic
decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and
high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating
the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this
challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures
realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement
learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception
prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which
drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as
positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against
a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack
scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower
average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones.
This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a
strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without
displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are
publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration
illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DINOZAUR is a diffusion-based neural operator that improves scalability and uncertainty quantification over FNOs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNOs suffer from scalability issues and lack native uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in scientific applications.

Method: DINOZAUR replaces dense tensor multipliers in FNOs with a diffusion-based, dimensionality-independent multiplier and incorporates Bayesian priors for uncertainty.

Result: DINOZAUR achieves competitive or superior performance on PDE benchmarks with efficient uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: DINOZAUR addresses key limitations of FNOs, offering scalable and reliable uncertainty-aware operator learning.

Abstract: Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted
foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to
overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key
requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead,
neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive
biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator
parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of
the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a
dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable
time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory
footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over
those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield
spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method
achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks
while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajSurv is a model for trustworthy survival prediction using longitudinal EHR data, leveraging NCDE for continuous latent trajectories and contrastive learning for alignment, with superior accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and transparent survival prediction from irregularly sampled EHR data is challenging but crucial for clinical decisions.

Method: TrajSurv uses NCDE to model continuous latent trajectories, aligns them with patient states via contrastive learning, and interprets trajectories through a two-step process.

Result: TrajSurv outperforms existing methods in accuracy and transparency on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets.

Conclusion: TrajSurv provides a reliable and interpretable solution for survival prediction from EHR data.

Abstract: Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making.
Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful
opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model
the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly
sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival
outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns
continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy
survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation
(NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled
data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories
reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with
patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To
transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses
latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process.
First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the
latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters
these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns
associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world
medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and
superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.

TL;DR: Proposes DP-DGAD, a dynamic graph anomaly detection model using dynamic prototypes to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist GAD models struggle with dynamic graphs and lack labeled data, necessitating a method to capture evolving anomalies across domains.

Method: DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes from temporal ego-graphs, updates a memory buffer selectively, and uses an anomaly scorer with confidence-based pseudo-labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from various domains.

Conclusion: DP-DGAD effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic graph anomaly detection by capturing evolving patterns and adapting to new domains.

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies
in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social
networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown
promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and
generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to
capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous
emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge
generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and
domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve
temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a
DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and
domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,
evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal
ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively
updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new
domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with
dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,
DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised
adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different
domains.

*Young-ho Cho,Hao Zhu,Duehee Lee,Ross Baldick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining GDFM and GAN to synthesize wind power scenarios, improving spatial and temporal correlation accuracy compared to standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the synthesis of long-term wind power scenarios by addressing limitations of existing methods (GDFM and GAN) in capturing spatial and temporal correlations.

Method: Uses GAN to extract dynamic factors with temporal info, then applies these in GDFM to model spatial and frequency correlations.

Result: Numerical tests show improved performance in synthesizing wind power scenarios, better matching actual statistical characteristics.

Conclusion: The combined GDFM-GAN approach outperforms alternatives, offering more plausible wind power scenario synthesis.

Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term
wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the
spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal
and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and
statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios
requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and
antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor
model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density
analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize
plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples
through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN,
we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal
information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the
GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible
waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated
performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power
scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical
characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM
with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the
GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.

Motivation: To improve AI-assisted diagnostic tools for mental health by evaluating model performance and data balancing methods.

Method: Compared traditional ML (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, XGBoost) and DL (DistilBERT, SciBERT) models, tested oversampling (None, Random, SMOTE), and applied hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Oversampling had minimal impact except SMOTE with BERT models. Hyperparameter tuning significantly boosted accuracy, with Decision Tree, XGBoost, DistilBERT, and SciBERT reaching 96%.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning is key for model performance, and BERT models benefit from SMOTE. The study aids in developing AI tools for mental health diagnostics.

Abstract: The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is
critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety
and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various
Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning
approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors,
Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT
and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses.
Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling,
Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to
assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also
applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling
techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception
was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models.
However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the
models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The
Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy
among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and
SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These
findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model
performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted
diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of
different model architectures and data balancing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafted structural features in GNNs increase computational cost and bias. The paper aims to remove this dependency while improving performance.

Method: Introduces attention and message-iteration profiles, trains on diverse synthetic networks, and applies to network dismantling.

Result: MIND generalizes to large real networks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient, generalizable, and applicable to other complex network problems.

Abstract: The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a
breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive
performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs,
which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise
purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for
handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing
message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to
generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks.
Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to
efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually
equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world
applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed
model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large,
unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art
network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the
proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex
network problems.

*Yannik Schnitzer,Alessandro Abate,David Parker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for solving and learning robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) using factored state-space representations, improving sample efficiency and policy robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning r-MDPs efficiently while ensuring robust policies with performance guarantees, especially given the high sample complexity of existing methods.

Method: Proposes novel methods leveraging factored state-space representations to exploit independence between model uncertainties. Reformulates non-convex optimization problems into tractable linear programs and learns factored models directly.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate dimensional gains in sample efficiency and more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Factored representations significantly enhance the efficiency and robustness of learning and solving r-MDPs, offering practical advantages over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling
epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from
interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust
policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a
large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and
learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the
independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although
policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation
problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs.
Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model
representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting
factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing
more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces JSON-Bag, a token-based method for representing game trajectories, using JSD for distance metrics and P-NNS for evaluation. It outperforms hand-crafted features in classification tasks and shows efficiency in N-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generic representation of game trajectories for classification tasks, avoiding reliance on hand-crafted features.

Method: Tokenize JSON descriptions of game trajectories, use JSD as a distance metric, and evaluate with P-NNS on six games for classification tasks.

Result: Outperforms hand-crafted features, shows sample efficiency in N-shot learning, and improves accuracy with Random Forest. JSD correlates with policy distances.

Conclusion: JSON-Bag is effective for game trajectory representation and classification, offering automatic feature extraction and policy distance insights.

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically
represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply
Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a
prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of
JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders},
\textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop},
\textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory
classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game
seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the
majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag
prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient.
Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction
by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve
the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming
tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag
prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between
agents' policies.

*Yingxu Wang,Mengzhu Wang,Zhichao Huang,Suyu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeGPR is a novel framework for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels, using dual branches and nested refinement to improve robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GDA methods assume clean source labels, but real-world scenarios often have noisy labels, degrading performance.

Method: NeGPR pretrains semantic and topology branches, uses nested refinement for cross-domain learning, and adds noise-aware regularization.

Result: NeGPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.7% in accuracy under severe label noise.

Conclusion: NeGPR effectively addresses noisy label challenges in GDA, enhancing adaptation robustness and performance.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled
source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant
representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property
prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely
on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world
scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely
impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain
shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label
Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain
adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,
semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the
feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge
domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch
selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,
enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels
may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to
the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware
regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to
mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of
source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains
of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

*Liuyun Xu,Seymour M. J. Spence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced to efficiently estimate small failure probabilities in stochastic simulations, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing variance reduction techniques require many model evaluations for rare event analysis, which is computationally challenging for complex systems like nonlinear finite element models under stochastic excitation.

Method: A high-fidelity dataset trains a deep learning metamodel as a low-fidelity surrogate. An adaptive training scheme balances approximation quality and computational cost. Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo integrates low- and high-fidelity results for unbiased failure probability estimates.

Result: The method accurately estimates exceedance probabilities for nonlinear responses in a high-rise steel building under wind excitation, with significant computational savings over single-fidelity approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme efficiently estimates small failure probabilities while reducing computational demands, making it suitable for complex systems.

Abstract: Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for
rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to
estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear
finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally
challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To
address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with
adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating
uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a
high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a
deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly
correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to
balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand
associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the
low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased
estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a
multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is
then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale
high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates
that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves
for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational
savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and storage inefficiencies of Bayesian neural networks and deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification.

Method: Uses kernel density estimation to derive an information potential field for feature space density, comparing test samples to detect distributional shifts and OOD.

Result: Outperforms baseline models on synthetic datasets (Two Moons, Three Spirals) and OOD detection (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN).

Conclusion: The method effectively quantifies uncertainty and detects OOD with a single deterministic model, offering computational and storage advantages.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble methods have been proposed for
uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and
require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve
the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density
to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived
from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the
training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation
of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift
has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons
and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The
results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDAE, a framework combining diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning for better anomaly detection in tabular data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in tabular data is difficult due to complex feature interactions and few anomalous examples. Existing methods like denoising autoencoders and diffusion models have limitations in adaptability and reconstruction.

Method: DDAE integrates diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into encoding. It was tested on 57 datasets from ADBench.

Result: DDAE outperforms in semi-supervised settings and is competitive in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65% and ROC-AUC by 16%.

Conclusion: Principled noise strategies are crucial for tabular anomaly detection, with higher noise benefiting unsupervised training and lower noise with linear scheduling optimal for semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in tabular data remains challenging due to complex feature
interactions and the scarcity of anomalous examples. Denoising autoencoders
rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data
distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative
denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the
Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates
diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding
process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from
ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves
competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65%
(9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion)
model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised
training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in
semi-supervised settings. These findings underscore the importance of
principled noise strategies in tabular anomaly detection.

Motivation: To explore how the selection of rotational gates in quantum circuits affects the accuracy of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models, particularly VQCs.

Method: The study compares Amplitude- and Angle-encoding models with different rotational gates, training them on Wine and Diabetes datasets to evaluate performance.

Result: Accuracy differences between the best and worst models range from 10% to 30%, with peaks of 41%. The choice of rotational gates significantly impacts performance.

Conclusion: The embedding method (rotational gate choice) is a critical hyperparameter for VQC models in QML.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning have increased
attention to Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which aims to develop machine
learning models by exploiting the quantum computing paradigm. One of the widely
used models in this area is the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a hybrid
model where the quantum circuit handles data inference while classical
optimization adjusts the parameters of the circuit. The quantum circuit
consists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a
template circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data.
This work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and
Angle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied
affects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried
out by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and
evaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical
model topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models
ranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%. Moreover, the
results highlight how the choice of rotational gates used in encoding can
significantly impact the model's classification performance. The findings
confirm that the embedding represents a hyperparameter for VQC models.

Result: Adacc accelerates LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: Adacc effectively balances memory efficiency and training performance, offering a practical solution for LLM training overhead.

Abstract: Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate
memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework
that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the
GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific
compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of
directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We
propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best
memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training
tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the
policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that
Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to
state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the
Baseline.

TL;DR: A data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear systems using invariant polytopes and linear-matrix-inequality problems for safe, model-free control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion-planning relies on system dynamics models, which may not always be available. This work aims to achieve safe, dynamically feasible paths using only data.

Method: Constructs overlapping invariant polytopes around waypoints, learns ellipsoidal invariant sets with local state-feedback gains, and ensures safe transitions via convex-hull polytopes and simplex-based interpolation.

Result: Simulations validate the method's effectiveness in achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems without relying on system dynamics models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables safe motion-planning for nonlinear systems using data-driven techniques, eliminating the need for explicit system models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear
systems that constructs a sequence of overlapping invariant polytopes. Around
each randomly sampled waypoint, the algorithm identifies a convex admissible
region and solves data-driven linear-matrix-inequality problems to learn
several ellipsoidal invariant sets together with their local state-feedback
gains. The convex hull of these ellipsoids, still invariant under a
piece-wise-affine controller obtained by interpolating the gains, is then
approximated by a polytope. Safe transitions between nodes are ensured by
verifying the intersection of consecutive convex-hull polytopes and introducing
an intermediate node for a smooth transition. Control gains are interpolated in
real time via simplex-based interpolation, keeping the state inside the
invariant polytopes throughout the motion. Unlike traditional approaches that
rely on system dynamics models, our method requires only data to compute safe
regions and design state-feedback controllers. The approach is validated
through simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in
achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems.

It characterizes modifications to update rules that maintain convergence properties and demonstrates effectiveness in applications like MPC and linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance worst-case guarantees with improved performance on practical problem instances, especially in high-stakes engineering applications like MPC.

Method: Characterizes modifications to update rules of baseline linearly convergent algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, Nesterov's method) that preserve convergence. Validates the approach on ill-conditioned linear systems and MPC.

Result: Derives all possible modifications to update rules that maintain linear convergence, showing effectiveness in targeted applications.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tailors algorithms for specific problems without sacrificing worst-case guarantees, enhancing practical performance.

Abstract: In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come
with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of
problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices
performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We
address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to
improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -
for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control
(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its
worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we
characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for
classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting
from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the
modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our
results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for
nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for
strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over
polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on
solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to
ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.

Motivation: To improve the generation of jet images for HEP research by leveraging diffusion models directly in image space, avoiding latent distribution limitations.

Method: Diffusion models are trained on 2D jet images from the JetNet dataset, comparing score-based and consistency models for class-conditional generation.

Result: Consistency models outperform score-based diffusion models in fidelity (measured by FID) and stability, enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of consistency models for high-fidelity jet image generation, advancing tools for HEP research.

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion
models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision
events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark,
gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset
are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are
trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents.
We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency
models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches
based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The
fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency
models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based
diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in
computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for
High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

Conclusion: The method has strong potential for improving root resorption assessment and clinical decision-making in orthodontics, with implementation and dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains
challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical
for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel
approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a

continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This
instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex
root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our
method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public
medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance,
averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the
second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test
sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root
segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root

Result: Achieved Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm for segmentation; false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9% for detection.

Conclusion: The method shows superior performance and generalizability for IA detection and segmentation.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels
that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their
small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to
perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are
critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large
public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for
developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we
proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates
vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in
time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA
detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to
derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention
block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary
branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth
segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same
database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it
externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm
segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =
1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CADS is an open-source framework for whole-body CT segmentation, integrating a large-scale dataset (22,022 CT volumes) and a model for robust clinical deployment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI segmentation models are fragmented and lack comprehensive training data for whole-body CT scans, hindering clinical utility.

Method: CADS systematically integrates and standardizes heterogeneous data sources, using a large-scale dataset (167 anatomical structures) to train a segmentation model.

Result: The CADS-model outperforms SoTA approaches in evaluations across 18 public datasets and a real-world hospital cohort, showing clinical utility.

Conclusion: CADS advances AI in radiology by providing a scalable, open-source solution for comprehensive anatomical analysis, benefiting clinicians and researchers.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

*Sumin Seo,In Kyu Lee,Hyun-Woo Kim,Jaesik Min,Chung-Hwan Jung*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel data augmentation method using diffusion models for generating realistic coronary lesions improves stenosis detection and severity classification, even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary stenosis is a critical condition requiring precise assessment, but deep learning methods face challenges like limited labeled data and class imbalance.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model-based inpainting technique for data augmentation, enabling user-controlled lesion severity generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in lesion detection and severity classification, especially with limited data, on both in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances stenosis assessment and optimizes data use, offering reliable decision support in clinical settings.

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to
increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require
meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical
visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed
decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have
shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of
stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent
approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and
class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach
that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic
lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on
lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset
sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house
dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach
maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with
limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment
of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable
decision support.

TL;DR: FMPlug is a plug-in framework enhancing foundation flow-matching priors for inverse problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, limiting their effectiveness. FMPlug aims to leverage domain-agnostic foundation models more efficiently.

Method: FMPlug uses a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, capitalizing on object similarity and Gaussianity of generative flows.

Result: FMPlug significantly outperforms existing methods using foundation FM priors in tasks like image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Conclusion: FMPlug demonstrates the potential of domain-agnostic foundation models for solving ill-posed inverse problems effectively.

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation
flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike
traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

TL;DR: A novel satellite clustering framework for collaborative deep learning-based space object detection (SOD) is proposed, improving accuracy and efficiency while maintaining low SWaP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing satellite density in LEO raises collision risks, and ground-based tracking systems are limited by latency and coverage, necessitating onboard, vision-based SOD solutions.

Method: A satellite clustering framework is introduced, using a high-fidelity dataset and distance-aware viewpoint selection to optimize DL-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites.

Result: The clustering method achieves competitive detection accuracy with low SWaP, outperforming single-satellite and existing approaches.

Conclusion: Distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems can enhance space situational awareness and support long-term space sustainability.

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious
challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of
in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained
by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard,
vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative
execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To
support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging
scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint
selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent
DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the
clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to
single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight,
and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of
distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness
and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

### [232] [Generative Logic: A New Computer Architecture for Deterministic Reasoning and Knowledge Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00017)
*Nikolai Sergeev*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Generative Logic (GL) is a deterministic architecture that explores axiomatic definitions using Logic Blocks (LBs) to generate auditable proof graphs. A prototype demonstrates its application in first-order Peano arithmetic, reconstructing foundational laws and exporting proofs to HTML. Future work includes parallel hardware-software co-design and integration with probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic, auditable framework for exploring axiomatic definitions and generating proofs, with potential applications in formal verification and autoformalization.

Method: GL compiles definitions into a grid of Logic Blocks (LBs) that exchange messages, unifying expressions under inference rules to emit new facts with provenance. A prototype implements this for Peano arithmetic.

Result: GL successfully reconstructs proofs of foundational arithmetic laws (e.g., associativity, commutativity) and exports them as navigable HTML.

Conclusion: GL offers a scalable, auditable approach to formal reasoning, with future potential for parallelization and integration with probabilistic models like LLMs.

Abstract: We present Generative Logic (GL), a deterministic architecture that begins
from user-supplied axiomatic definitions -- written in a minimalist
Mathematical Programming Language (MPL) -- and systematically explores their
deductive neighborhood. Definitions are compiled into a distributed grid of
simple Logic Blocks (LBs) that exchange messages; any time several expressions
unify under an inference rule, a new fact is emitted with full provenance to
its sources, yielding replayable, auditable proof graphs.
  A prototype software implementation instantiates the workflow on first-order
Peano arithmetic. Starting only from the Peano axioms, GL enumerates candidate
implications, applies normalization and type filters, and automatically
reconstructs machine-checkable proofs of foundational arithmetic laws including
associativity and commutativity of addition, associativity and commutativity of
multiplication, and distributivity. Generated proofs export to navigable HTML
so that every inference step can be inspected independently.
  We outline a hardware-software co-design path toward massively parallel
realizations and describe prospective integration with probabilistic models
(e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) for autoformalization and conjecture
seeding. The Python and MPL code to reproduce the Peano experiments, along with
the full HTML proof graphs, are available in the project's GitHub repository at

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish a correspondence between (fragments of)
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, a temporal extension of the $\mathcal{EL}$
description logic with the LTL operator $\bigcirc^k$, and some specific kinds
of formal grammars, in particular, conjunctive grammars (context-free grammars
equipped with the operation of intersection). This connection implies that
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$ does not possess the property of ultimate periodicity
of models, and further leads to undecidability of query answering in
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, closing a question left open since the introduction
of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$. Moreover, it also allows to establish decidability
of query answering for some new interesting fragments of
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, and to reuse for this purpose existing tools and
algorithms for conjunctive grammars.

*Varun Bharti,Shashwat Jha,Dhruv Kumar,Pankaj Jalote*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper explores using reasoning-optimized large language models (LLMs) to automate loop invariant synthesis, achieving 100% coverage on the Code2Inv benchmark, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loop invariants are crucial for program correctness but challenging to synthesize automatically. Existing methods have limited success, prompting investigation into LLMs' potential.

Method: Integrates OpenAI's LLMs (O1, O1-mini, O3-mini) with Z3 SMT solver in a generate-and-check pipeline, using solver counterexamples for iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves 100% coverage (133/133 tasks) on Code2Inv benchmark, surpassing the previous best (107/133), with minimal model proposals (1-2) and fast execution (14-55 seconds).

Conclusion: LLMs show latent logical reasoning capabilities for loop invariant synthesis, suggesting generalizability to other imperative languages.

Abstract: Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with
loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis
cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed
to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using
neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop
invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we
investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do
better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled
generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver
counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv
benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and
postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100%
coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133,
while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of
wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical
reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While
our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be
generalizable to other imperative languages.

*Jack A. Kilgallen,Barak A. Pearlmutter,Jeffrey Mark Siskind*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'repeated-stimulus confound' in neural-decoding studies, where using the same stimuli for training and evaluation inflates accuracy by 4.46-7.42%, undermining validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight a methodological flaw in neural-decoding studies where repeated stimuli inflate model performance, leading to overestimated results and invalid claims.

Method: Analyzed susceptible datasets and 16 publications, conducted experiments with affected models, and tested implications in alternative contexts.

Result: Decoding accuracies were overestimated by 4.46-7.42%, with a 0.26% increase in overestimation per 1% accuracy under the confound. The confound also validated pseudoscientific claims.

Conclusion: The repeated-stimulus confound significantly biases neural-decoding results, necessitating methodological revisions to ensure accurate and valid findings.

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli
are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of
publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research
to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments
have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in
some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant
to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However,
when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the
same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this
the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16
publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures
affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the
affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the
literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding
accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our
analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound,
the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only
results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the
validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted
further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in
alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the
affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific
claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing internet infrastructure is unsuitable for large-scale agent collaboration, necessitating new protocols aligned with trends like agent interconnection and autonomy.

Method: ANP employs a three-layer protocol system (identity/encryption, meta-protocol negotiation, application) for agent authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery.

Result: ANP systematically resolves agent identity, negotiation, and interoperability challenges while maintaining compatibility with current internet protocols.

Conclusion: ANP is a scalable, modular solution for the Agentic Web, enabling seamless agent collaboration and rapid deployment on existing infrastructure.

Abstract: With the development of large models and autonomous decision-making AI,
agents are rapidly becoming the new entities of the internet, following mobile
apps. However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human
interaction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration
costs among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale
agent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound
transformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional
software, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections,
and autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these
trends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication
protocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains
compatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable
architecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid
deployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol
system--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation
layer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet HRLLC requirements for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving by integrating NTN (e.g., HAPS) into 6G for redundancy and enhanced communication reliability.

Method: Uses deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for dynamic AoI optimization in HAPS-enabled V2X networks, enabling independent learning without centralized coordination.

Result: Improves information freshness and network reliability, demonstrating potential for AoI-aware resource allocation in autonomous vehicle systems.

Conclusion: HAPS-supported solutions with DDPG-based learning are effective for efficient AoI optimization in 6G V2X networks.

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and
low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications
such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the
6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of
communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude
platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency
advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information
freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure
constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches
using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the
age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks.
The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network
reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination.

TL;DR: A scalable framework combines Markov chain modeling and ITU-R propagation models to predict spectrum availability for dynamic access, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectrum resources are underutilized, requiring dynamic access strategies to exploit unused frequencies without interfering with primary users.

Method: Uses a two-state Markov chain for temporal patterns and ITU-R propagation models (P.528, P.2108) for spatial analysis to predict spectrum availability.

Result: The approach effectively identifies available spectrum with low computational cost, suitable for real-time management in cognitive radio networks.

Conclusion: The framework is flexible, scalable, and accurate, making it viable for dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating
dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused
frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be
available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive
and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for
spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model
of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R
(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures
temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss
and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference
thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the
proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with
improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach,
analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions,
limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be
adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show
that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low
computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in
cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

TL;DR: A DRL-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework is proposed to optimize edge LLM services by addressing dynamic workloads, heterogeneity, and interference, improving QoS and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud-based LLM services face high latency, instability, and privacy issues, necessitating edge deployment. Existing routing algorithms fail to handle LLM heterogeneity, request interference, and dynamic workloads.

Method: Proposes a DRL-based framework with dynamic state abstraction (using HAN), an action impact estimator, and a tailored reward function to optimize QoS and prevent latency violations.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in average QoS and computing resource efficiency over baselines under Poisson and real-world workloads.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in edge LLM routing, ensuring sustained high-quality services.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However,
cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable
responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually
deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data
privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.
Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical
issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an
appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable
quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously
address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and
the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet
these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning
(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM
services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic
state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a
heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an
action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent
in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on
both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared
to existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper explores AI-enabled solutions for secure communications in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), proposing a novel LAM-based framework to enhance security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, mobility, and unlicensed spectrum use, making them vulnerable to attacks. Traditional AI methods have limitations in addressing these issues.

Method: The study introduces large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) and proposes a LAM-based optimization framework using large language models (LLMs) to improve reinforcement learning for secure communication tasks.

Result: Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing secure communications in LAWNs.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of LAMs for secure LAWN applications and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize
communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel
delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional
wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude
operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it
more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some
large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure
communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security
risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we
introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in
addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for
secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization
framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced
state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic
rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for
secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline
future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.

Motivation: AI-native 6G networks face accuracy degradation due to concept drifts from non-stationary wireless environments. Existing methods are domain-specific or ineffective for certain drifts.

Result: The methods outperform classical detectors (ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM) by 20-40 percentage points, achieving F1-scores of 0.94 and 1.00 for retraining alarms.

Conclusion: The proposed detectors effectively mitigate concept drift in 6G networks, significantly improving accuracy and reducing false alarms compared to existing methods.

Abstract: AI-native 6G networks promise unprecedented automation and performance by
embedding machine-learning models throughout the radio access and core segments
of the network. However, the non-stationary nature of wireless environments due
to infrastructure changes, user mobility, and emerging traffic patterns,
induces concept drifts that can quickly degrade these model accuracies.
Existing methods in general are very domain specific, or struggle with certain
type of concept drift. In this paper, we introduce two unsupervised,
model-agnostic, batch concept drift detectors. Both methods compute an
expected-utility score to decide when concept drift occurred and if model
retraining is warranted, without requiring ground-truth labels after
deployment. We validate our framework on two real-world wireless use cases in
outdoor fingerprinting for localization and for link-anomaly detection, and
demonstrate that both methods are outperforming classical detectors such as
ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM by 20-40 percentage points. Additionally, they achieve an
F1-score of 0.94 and 1.00 in correctly triggering retraining alarm, thus
reducing the false alarm rate by up to 20 percentage points compared to the
best classical detectors.

### [243] [When Relevance Meets Novelty: Dual-Stable Periodic Optimization for Exploratory Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00450)
*Hongxiang Lin,Hao Guo,Zeshun Li,Erpeng Xue,Yongqian He,Xiangyu Hou,Zhaoyu Hu,Lei Wang,Sheng Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) to address biases and static optimization in LLM-enhanced recommendation systems, introducing DSIE for interest modeling and PCO for dynamic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems create feedback loops, limiting exploration. LLM-enhanced frameworks fail to address long-term preferences and static optimization.

Method: CoEA includes DSIE for dual interest modeling (group identity and individual interests) and PCO for periodic, dynamic optimization using incremental data.

Result: Experiments show CoEA's effectiveness in exploratory recommendation.

Conclusion: CoEA successfully mitigates biases and enables dynamic optimization in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback
loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences,
thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue.
Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse
content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks
face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven
by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer
from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to
leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these
challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For
interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE)
module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual
interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static
optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO)
mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on
incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to
perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds
back the output of the incrementally fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance
LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization.
Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA
model in exploratory recommendation.

*Chuan He,Yongchao Liu,Qiang Li,Wenliang Zhong,Chuntao Hong,Xinwei Yao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces M^2VAE, a generative model for cold-start item recommendation, addressing multi-view modality structure and user preferences via disentangled contrastive learning and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start item recommendation is challenging due to lack of historical data. Existing methods ignore multi-view modality structures and shared/unique feature distinctions.

Method: Proposes M^2VAE, using type-specific latent variables and Product-of-Experts for common representation. Employs disentangled contrastive loss and preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts for user preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: M^2VAE successfully addresses cold-start challenges by modeling multi-view modalities and user preferences adaptively.

Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation
systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical
interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to
alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view
structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific
features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational
AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of
modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well
as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate
type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image
features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A
disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while
preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a
preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations.
We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning,
eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to improve A/B testing efficiency in ranking algorithms for search and recommender systems, achieving up to 100x sensitivity increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Businesses struggle with time-consuming and low-power A/B tests for conversion metrics, while offline evaluations lack accuracy for candidate selection.

Method: Developed interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods for rapid online assessments to identify promising A/B test candidates.

Result: Increased experiment sensitivity by up to 100x compared to traditional A/B testing and streamlined the experimental process.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance A/B testing efficiency and offer practical insights for organizations with similar challenges.

Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on
search and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create
user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective
manner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal
inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B
test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine
and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to
effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for
conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant
purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker
and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for
selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed
interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online
assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our
approach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to
100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing
but also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained
from usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.

*Arthur Paul Pedersen,Samuel Allen Alexander*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: A general theory of coherent preference is introduced, relaxing orthodox restrictions and allowing any preference system to extend to a complete one if it meets a coherence requirement. Unlike de Finetti's theory, it avoids transitivity, Archimedeanness, boundedness, or continuity. The theory also ensures representability by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more flexible theory of preference that avoids restrictive assumptions like transitivity and Archimedeanness while maintaining coherence.

Method: Proposes a coherence requirement analogous to de Finetti's for probability, extending Holder's Theorem and strengthening Hahn's Embedding Theorem.

Result: Any complete preference system meeting coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals.

Conclusion: The theory provides a robust framework for preference systems without traditional constraints, with utility representability as a key outcome.

Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders
restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property
that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of
preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to
the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de
Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor
Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also
enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of
coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the
reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central
result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's
Embedding Theorem.

TL;DR: A novel multi-agent system with internal competition improves LLM-based trading by reducing sensitivity to market noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High sensitivity to market noise limits LLM-based trading systems' performance.

Method: Proposes a two-team system (Data and Research Teams) with real-time evaluation and ranking based on market feedback.

Result: Outperforms existing multi-agent systems and traditional methods in trading performance.

Conclusion: The system enhances robustness and adapts dynamically to market changes.

Abstract: In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate
significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines
the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism
inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two
specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing
massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the
model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making
parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The
core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking
mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's
performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from
top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to
adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market
noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms
prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods
across diverse evaluation metrics.

Motivation: SSMs are efficient for long-range modeling but static during deployment; this work enables dynamic adaptation to incoming data.

Method: Online parameter updates using real-time recurrent learning, tested on linear-recurrent-unit SSMs with a carbon emission dataset.

Result: Reduced prediction error during online inference, showing promise for dynamic, resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: The approach enhances SSMs' adaptability, making them suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of
structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time
recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range
modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static
during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously

approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset
collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our
method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce cognitive load on users and improve prosthetic hand control by leveraging imitation learning for grasping tasks.

Method: Uses imitation learning with a diffusion policy trained on the HannesImitationDataset, which includes diverse grasping demonstrations.

Result: Successful grasps across varied objects and conditions, outperforming a segmentation-based visual servo controller.

Conclusion: Imitation learning is effective for prosthetic hand control, enabling operation in unstructured scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing
autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim
to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain
degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising
approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying
data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,
however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity
restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained
scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on
manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an
imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling
object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the
HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and
human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single
diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist
orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that
the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in
unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page:

Motivation: Enhance robot navigation in unstructured environments by leveraging multimodal sensor data (RGB, depth, thermal) for accurate terrain perception, inspired by Martian exploration needs.

Method: Developed OmniUnet, a transformer-based architecture, and a custom sensor housing for RGB-D-T data collection. Labeled a dataset from Bardenas semi-desert for supervised training.

Result: Achieved 80.37% pixel accuracy and 673 ms average prediction time on a Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating strong segmentation performance.

Conclusion: OmniUnet is effective for multimodal terrain perception, with publicly available software and dataset to aid planetary robotics research.

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception
systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration
of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this
information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically
designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to
identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the
target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable
for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between
soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network
architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T)
imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and
mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a
multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location
serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring
terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset
was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model
was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy
of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex
unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673
ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its
suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network
and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future

TL;DR: UAV-ON is a benchmark for aerial Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) in open-world environments, addressing limitations of VLN by using semantic goals instead of detailed instructions. It includes diverse environments and annotated objects, with baselines like AOA showing the challenges of aerial navigation and semantic grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) relies on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting scalability and autonomy. UAV-ON aims to enable aerial agents to navigate using high-level semantic goals in unstructured environments.

Method: UAV-ON introduces 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with 1270 annotated target objects, each described by instance-level instructions. The Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA) integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for exploration.

Result: Baseline methods, including AOA, struggle in UAV-ON, highlighting the challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding.

Conclusion: UAV-ON advances scalable UAV autonomy by focusing on semantic goal-driven navigation in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: Omni-Scan is a bi-manual robot pipeline for creating high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models by rotating objects and using AI models to remove occlusions, achieving 83% accuracy in defect inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object scanning methods are limited by workspace constraints. Omni-Scan aims to overcome this by using a robot to manipulate objects for full 360-degree coverage.

Method: The pipeline uses a bi-manual robot to rotate objects, combined with DepthAnything, Segment Anything, and RAFT optical flow models to isolate objects and remove occlusions. The 3DGS training pipeline is modified to handle gripper occlusion.

Result: Omni-Scan achieves 83% accuracy in identifying visual or geometric defects in 12 industrial and household objects.

Conclusion: Omni-Scan provides an effective solution for high-quality 3D object modeling and defect inspection, leveraging robotics and AI.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policies face computational inefficiency and high memory usage on mobile platforms, limiting their deployment.

Method: LightDP uses network compression (pruning and retraining) and consistency distillation to reduce latency and sampling steps.

Result: LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance on standard datasets.

Conclusion: LightDP enables practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments, matching state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) variant using weighted sinusoidal functions, proving its validity and showing competitive performance against MLPs and fixed-frequency Fourier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to spline-based activations in KANs and leverage the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem for efficient multivariable function representation.

Method: Replace inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions, fixing phases to constant values, and validate theoretically.

Result: The proposed KAN variant outperforms fixed-frequency Fourier methods and matches MLPs in performance.

Conclusion: The sinusoidal-based KAN is a valid and competitive alternative for multivariable function approximation.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous
multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of
continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this
representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a
smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the
proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron
networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical
direction of most modern neural networks.
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an
alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear
activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis
spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and
sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works
have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we
propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of
learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and
Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced
constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also
conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of
multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform
methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the
fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.

### [258] [Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00398)
*Sunjae Yoon,Gwanhyeong Koo,Younghwan Lee,Ji Woo Hong,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces OSF, an occlusion-robust framework for drawing-based 3D animation, addressing style deterioration under occlusions by using optical flow for edge guidance, improving speed and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving an artist's unique style in drawing-based 3D animation is challenging due to quality deterioration under occlusions, caused by a 'stylization pose gap' between training and inference.

Method: Proposes OSF, which uses optical flow for occlusion-robust edge guidance in stylization networks, operating in a single run instead of two stages.

Result: OSF ensures consistent stylization under occlusions, achieves 2.4x faster inference, and uses 2.1x less memory compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OSF effectively addresses the stylization pose gap, improving quality and efficiency in drawing-based 3D animation.

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

### [259] [SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782)
*Kien T. Pham,Yingqing He,Yazhou Xing,Qifeng Chen,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpA2V is a novel framework for audio-driven video generation that leverages spatial auditory cues to create videos with accurate semantic and spatial alignment, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on semantic information but lack spatial accuracy. Humans naturally use spatial auditory cues, which SpA2V aims to incorporate for better video generation.

Method: SpA2V uses a two-stage process: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning to create Video Scene Layouts (VSLs) using spatial and semantic cues, and 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation integrating VSLs into pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: SpA2V generates realistic videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence to input audios, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SpA2V advances audio-driven video generation by explicitly incorporating spatial auditory cues, enabling more accurate and realistic results.

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

*Le Wang,Jun Wang,Feng Deng,Chen Zhang,Kun Gai,Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AudioGen-Omni is a unified multimodal diffusion transformer model for generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs synchronized with video, using joint training and advanced cross-modal alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile model capable of generating semantically rich and acoustically diverse audio for various tasks, overcoming limitations of text-frozen paradigms.

Method: Employs a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDit) with a joint training paradigm, integrating video-text-audio corpora. Uses a unified lyrics-transcription encoder and AdaLN-based joint attention with PAAPI for precise cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks, with high semantic alignment, lip-sync accuracy, and efficient inference (1.91s for 8s audio).

Conclusion: AudioGen-Omni demonstrates superior audio generation quality, efficiency, and adaptability, making it a robust solution for multimodal audio synthesis.

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion
transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and
songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a
novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale
video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically
rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable
to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified
lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung
and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level
representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism
enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein
RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure
precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and
masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of
text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint
training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync
accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on
Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8
seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and
generality.

*Sophia Liu,Shm Garanganao Almeda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Hypertextual Friction' to reclaim user agency in algorithm-driven interfaces by emphasizing hypertext principles like friction, traceability, and structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithm-driven interfaces prioritize engagement and efficiency over user agency, reducing control and meaning-making for users.

Method: Comparative analysis of interfaces (Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, Are.na vs. GenAI tools) to examine how systems shape user experience and agency.

Result: Hypertext systems promote provenance and user-driven meaning, while algorithmic systems obscure process and flatten participation.

Conclusion: Hypertextual Friction offers a design stance to reclaim agency in algorithmic environments by valuing hypertext principles.

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI
tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user
agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over
what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed.
This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that
repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and
structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically
mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world
interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image
tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation,
and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance,
associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems
tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a
comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven
versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers
hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an
increasingly algorithmic web.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating AI in education (AIED) via Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), addressing challenges like teacher involvement, AI reliability, and resource accessibility. It introduces Augmented Intelligence (AuI) to enhance human capabilities, presenting MathAIde, an ITS for math exercises, validated through prototyping and real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance learning experiences with AIED while addressing its challenges, particularly the role of teachers, AI limitations, and accessibility.

Method: Designing MathAIde, an ITS for math exercises, using brainstorming, prototyping, A/B testing, and real-world case studies.

Result: Identified design possibilities for AuI in ITS, emphasizing user needs and feasibility, with real-world validation showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: A teacher-centered design approach improves AIED adoption, especially in resource-limited settings, balancing human and AI roles.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) aims to enhance
learning experiences through technologies like Intelligent Tutoring Systems
(ITS), offering personalized learning, increased engagement, and improved
retention rates. However, AIED faces three main challenges: the critical role
of teachers in the design process, the limitations and reliability of AI tools,
and the accessibility of technological resources. Augmented Intelligence (AuI)
addresses these challenges by enhancing human capabilities rather than
replacing them, allowing systems to suggest solutions. In contrast, humans
provide final assessments, thus improving AI over time. In this sense, this
study focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating MathAIde, an ITS that
corrects mathematics exercises using computer vision and AI and provides
feedback based on photos of student work. The methodology included
brainstorming sessions with potential users, high-fidelity prototyping, A/B
testing, and a case study involving real-world classroom environments for
teachers and students. Our research identified several design possibilities for
implementing AuI in ITSs, emphasizing a balance between user needs and
technological feasibility. Prioritization and validation through prototyping
and testing highlighted the importance of efficiency metrics, ultimately
leading to a solution that offers pre-defined remediation alternatives for
teachers. Real-world deployment demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed
solution. Our research contributes to the literature by providing a usable,
teacher-centered design approach that involves teachers in all design phases.
As a practical implication, we highlight that the user-centered design approach
increases the usefulness and adoption potential of AIED systems, especially in
resource-limited environments.

### [263] [Your Model Is Unfair, Are You Even Aware? Inverse Relationship Between Comprehension and Trust in Explainability Visualizations of Biased ML Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00140)
*Zhanna Kaufman,Madeline Endres,Cindy Xiong Bearfield,Yuriy Brun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how explainability visualizations in ML models affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust, finding an inverse relationship between comprehension and trust due to increased bias perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in ML systems impacts stakeholders' trust, and different backgrounds influence how systems are perceived. Understanding how explanations affect trust is crucial.

Method: Surveyed explainability visualizations, created a taxonomy, and conducted user studies with five tools (LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, ELI5) to measure effects on comprehension, bias perception, and trust.

Result: Found an inverse relationship: better comprehension increases bias perception, reducing trust. Visualization design can manipulate these factors, with fairness improvements boosting trust.

Conclusion: Visualization design plays a key role in responsible ML by balancing comprehension and trust, with fairness adjustments mitigating trust loss despite high comprehension.

Abstract: Systems relying on ML have become ubiquitous, but so has biased behavior
within them. Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust
in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different
backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models'
behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey
explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics.
We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools
(LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how
taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for
non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between
comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they
trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is
strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations
increase people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces
trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability
visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show
that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension,
increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model
bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design,
significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work
advances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically
investigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI music tools often require musical or technical knowledge, excluding non-musicians. DeformTune aims to provide a more intuitive and embodied interaction.

Method: Combines a tactile deformable interface with the MeasureVAE model. A study with 11 non-musicians analyzed their feedback through thematic analysis.

Result: Participants faced challenges like unclear control mappings and limited expressive range. Design opportunities include multimodal feedback and progressive interaction support.

Conclusion: DeformTune offers early insights into making AI music systems more explainable and accessible for novices.

Abstract: Many existing AI music generation tools rely on text prompts, complex
interfaces, or instrument-like controls, which may require musical or technical
knowledge that non-musicians do not possess. This paper introduces DeformTune,
a prototype system that combines a tactile deformable interface with the
MeasureVAE model to explore more intuitive, embodied, and explainable AI
interaction. We conducted a preliminary study with 11 adult participants
without formal musical training to investigate their experience with
AI-assisted music creation. Thematic analysis of their feedback revealed
recurring challenge--including unclear control mappings, limited expressive
range, and the need for guidance throughout use. We discuss several design
opportunities for enhancing explainability of AI, including multimodal feedback
and progressive interaction support. These findings contribute early insights
toward making AI music systems more explainable and empowering for novice
users.

*Brian Houck,Travis Lowdermilk,Cody Beyer,Steven Clarke,Ben Hanrahan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI tools in software development boost productivity for routine tasks but vary by task complexity and usage. They enhance efficiency and satisfaction but have limited impact on collaboration. Team culture and support are crucial for maximizing AI's value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI tools impact developer productivity and experience across the SPACE framework dimensions.

Method: Mixed-methods study involving surveys from 500+ developers, interviews, and observational studies.

Result: AI enhances productivity, especially for routine tasks, with benefits varying by task complexity and usage. Efficiency and satisfaction improve, but collaboration impact is minimal. Team culture and support are key.

Conclusion: AI augments developers rather than replacing them. Effective integration requires team culture and support structures, alongside practical recommendations for stakeholders.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in
software development workflows, questions persist about their true impact on
developer productivity and experience. This paper presents findings from a
mixed-methods study examining how developers perceive AI's influence across the
dimensions of the SPACE framework: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity,
Collaboration and Efficiency. Drawing on survey responses from over 500
developers and qualitative insights from interviews and observational studies,
we find that AI is broadly adopted and widely seen as enhancing productivity,
particularly for routine tasks. However, the benefits vary, depending on task
complexity, individual usage patterns, and team-level adoption. Developers
report increased efficiency and satisfaction, with less evidence of impact on
collaboration. Organizational support and peer learning play key roles in
maximizing AI's value. These findings suggest that AI is augmenting developers
rather than replacing them, and that effective integration depends as much on
team culture and support structures as on the tools themselves. We conclude
with practical recommendations for teams, organizations and researchers seeking
to harness AI's potential in software engineering.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Audiences attribute more artistic merit to AI-generated art when unaware of its AI origin, highlighting the role of social context in shaping perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore mixed opinions on AI-generated art and how awareness of AI involvement affects perceptions.

Method: Two versions of a dance performance (with/without GenAI) were shown to 39 participants, with AI involvement disclosed either before or after surveying perceptions.

Result: Participants rated AI-generated art higher when unaware of its AI origin.

Conclusion: Social context and user interpretations are crucial in shaping perceptions of AI-generated art, calling for broader discussions.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to
create art, stakeholders cannot come to an agreement on the value of these
works. In this study we uncovered the mixed opinions surrounding art made by
AI. We developed two versions of a dance performance augmented by technology
either with or without GenAI. For each version we informed audiences of the
performance's development either before or after a survey on their perceptions
of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female)
divided between the four performances. Results demonstrated that individuals
were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they
were unaware of its use. We present this case study as a call to address the
importance of utilizing the social context and the users' interpretations of
GenAI in shaping a technical explanation, leading to a greater discussion that
can bridge gaps in understanding.

TL;DR: MetaExplainer is a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges the gap between AI-generated explanations and user needs by using LLMs and an Explanation Ontology to produce tailored, question-driven explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between AI-generated explanations and user needs hinders trust in AI systems. MetaExplainer aims to provide user-centered explanations to enhance interpretability and trustworthiness.

Method: A three-stage process: (1) decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using LLMs, (2) generate system recommendations via model explainer methods, and (3) synthesize natural language explanations guided by an Explanation Ontology.

Result: High performance in question reframing (59.06% F1-score), faithfulness (70%), and context-utilization (67%). User studies confirm the creativity and comprehensiveness of explanations.

Conclusion: MetaExplainer is versatile and traceable, supporting diverse explanation types and showing promise for enhancing AI explainability across domains.

Abstract: Explanations are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, but a gap often
exists between the explanations provided by models and those needed by users.
To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework
designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a
three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable
formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate
the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and
finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the
explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology
to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a
structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance
the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various
applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that
better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate
a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation
frameworks. Our results show high performance across all stages, with a 59.06%
F1-score in question reframing, 70% faithfulness in model explanations, and 67%
context-utilization in natural language synthesis. User studies corroborate
these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated
explanations. Tested on the Diabetes (PIMA Indian) tabular dataset,
MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive,
Counterfactual, Rationale, Case-Based, and Data explanations. The framework's
versatility and traceability from using ontology to guide LLMs suggest broad
applicability beyond the tested scenarios, positioning MetaExplainer as a
promising tool for enhancing AI explainability across various domains.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks LLMs for generating Python code using unfamiliar APIs, finding GPT-4.1 as the only consistently successful model, while highlighting limitations in LLMs and library documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to generate functional Python code for complex tasks with unfamiliar APIs, addressing gaps in understanding their practical utility in scientific automation.

Method: Systematically evaluates LLMs using zero-shot prompts for two tasks: conversational data analysis and synthetic data generation/clustering, assessing functional correctness and prompt compliance.

Result: Few models consistently produce correct code; GPT-4.1 excels. Errors reveal issues in library documentation and implementation.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations for scientific automation, requiring better prompts, documentation, and model improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly as tools for automating
code generation in scientific research, yet their ability to interpret and use
unfamiliar Python APIs for complex computational experiments remains poorly
characterized. This study systematically benchmarks a selection of
state-of-the-art LLMs in generating functional Python code for two increasingly
challenging scenarios: conversational data analysis with the \textit{ParShift}
library, and synthetic data generation and clustering using \textit{pyclugen}
and \textit{scikit-learn}. Both experiments use structured, zero-shot prompts
specifying detailed requirements but omitting in-context examples. Model
outputs are evaluated quantitatively for functional correctness and prompt
compliance over multiple runs, and qualitatively by analyzing the errors
produced when code execution fails. Results show that only a small subset of
models consistently generate correct, executable code, with GPT-4.1 standing
out as the only model to always succeed in both tasks. In addition to
benchmarking LLM performance, this approach helps identify shortcomings in
third-party libraries, such as unclear documentation or obscure implementation
bugs. Overall, these findings highlight current limitations of LLMs for
end-to-end scientific automation and emphasize the need for careful prompt
design, comprehensive library documentation, and continued advances in language
model capabilities.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code
generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core
features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow,
from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope:
capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full
software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering
practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward
practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process
management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid
development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application
potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based
code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from
its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both
single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details
the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes
mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative
tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose
several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the

*Dong Huang,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Qianru Zhang,Mingzhe Du,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ULT is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in unit test generation, addressing data contamination and structural simplicity issues in existing benchmarks. It shows LLMs perform worse on ULT compared to simpler benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM test generation suffer from data contamination and overly simple function code, leading to unreliable conclusions.

Method: ULT is designed with a multi-stage curation process for high cyclomatic complexity and mitigated contamination, featuring 3,909 real-world Python functions. PLT is introduced as a controlled benchmark for memorization analysis.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on ULT (e.g., 41.32% accuracy) compared to TestEval and PLT, indicating ULT's higher challenge level.

Conclusion: ULT provides a more realistic and challenging benchmark for evaluating LLMs in test generation, highlighting limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating
unit test generation, significantly reducing the manual effort required by
developers. To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it
is crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects
real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test
generation benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination
and structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the
validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these
limited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to
contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural
simplicity.
  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new
benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from
real-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation
process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case
contamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides
a more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation
capabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT
with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization
versus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
ULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by
LLMs only achieve 41.32\%, 45.10\%, 30.22\%, and 40.21\% for accuracy,
statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all
LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the
corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\%, 92.18\%, 82.04\%, and 49.69\%) and
PLT (47.07\%, 55.13\%, 40.07\%, and 50.80\%).

### [272] [Accurate and Consistent Graph Model Generation from Text with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00255)
*Boqi Chen,Ou Wei,Bingzhou Zheng,Gunter Mussbacher*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an abstraction-concretization framework to improve graph model generation from natural language using LLMs, addressing syntax violations, constraint inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based graph model generation often produces partially correct models with syntax violations, constraint inconsistencies, and inaccuracies, which current methods inadequately address.

Method: The framework aggregates multiple LLM outputs into a probabilistic partial model and refines it into a concrete model satisfying all constraints.

Result: The approach significantly enhances the consistency and quality of generated graph models across diverse datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates issues in LLM-based graph model generation, improving reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Graph model generation from natural language description is an important task
with many applications in software engineering. With the rise of large language
models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model
generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces
partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax
violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its
metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not
conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the
inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated
elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as
constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed.
Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel
abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality
of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our
approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all
candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate
concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on
several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for
model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.

*Wenchao Gu,Zongyi Lyu,Yanlin Wang,Hongyu Zhang,Cuiyun Gao,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SPENCER improves code retrieval by combining dual-encoder efficiency with cross-encoder accuracy, using adaptive model distillation to reduce inference time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-encoders lack interaction between code and description, limiting performance. SPENCER aims to enhance effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: SPENCER uses a dual-encoder for initial search space reduction and a cross-encoder for accuracy. It introduces adaptive model distillation and a teaching assistant selection strategy.

Result: Combining dual-encoder and cross-encoder improves performance. Model distillation reduces inference time by 70% while retaining 98% performance.

Conclusion: SPENCER balances efficiency and accuracy in code retrieval, outperforming dual-encoder-only models.

Abstract: Code retrieval aims to provide users with desired code snippets based on
users' natural language queries. With the development of deep learning
technologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.
Considering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a
dual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into
representation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the
dual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the
interaction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the
model during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving
its efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model
Distillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts
the dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder
to improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel
model distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of
the dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a
teaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can
adaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different
pre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of
dual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely
dual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation
technique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the
inference time of the dual-encoder by 70%.

### [274] [Towards a Measure Theory of Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00525)
*George M. Coghill*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper critiques Floridi's theory of semantic information, proposes a new approach using the unit circle to measure informativeness, and resolves the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the flaws in Floridi's theory and resolve the paradox where contradictions are assigned maximum informativeness.

Method: A new approach based on the unit circle and von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for informativeness.

Result: Contradictions and tautologies have zero informativeness, but contradictory messages are equally informative. The paradox is resolved.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully meets Floridi's requirements and eliminates the paradox, offering a more coherent measure of semantic information.

Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of
Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the
informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach
assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to
as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a
distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.
Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on
its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new
approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of
theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy
with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for
informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and
removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have
zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each
other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an
example.

*Xiang Zhang,Zhou Li,Shuangyang Li,Kai Wan,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper explores decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) in federated learning, focusing on information-theoretic limits for communication and key usage, and establishes optimal bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works lack understanding of fundamental limits in decentralized secure aggregation, especially in communication and key usage without a central aggregator.

Method: The study models a network of K fully-connected users aiming to securely compute the sum of private inputs, with security constraints against collusion.

Result: Optimal bounds are derived: each user must transmit at least one symbol, hold one key symbol, and collectively hold K-1 independent key symbols.

Conclusion: The results provide fundamental limits for DSA, guiding the design of secure and efficient protocols in distributed learning.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively
learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held
datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the
intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques
are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite
growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on
protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the
fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal
bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,
where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the
problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic
perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,
each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who
aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires
that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up
to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies
the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In
particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input
sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at
least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no
fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the
fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of
provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning
systems.

*Jiecong Wang,Haoran Li,Hao Peng,Ziqian Zeng,Zihao Wang,Haohua Du,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A two-stage framework (AGILE) for jailbreaking models combines scenario-based generation and hidden-state-guided edits, outperforming baselines with a 37.74% higher attack success rate and strong transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods are either incoherent (token-level) or unscalable (prompt-level), necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) scenario-based context generation to obscure malicious intent, (2) hidden-state-guided fine-grained edits to steer representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate (up to 37.74% improvement) and strong transferability to black-box models.

Conclusion: AGILE highlights current defense limitations and provides insights for future safeguards, demonstrating its effectiveness against prominent defenses.

Abstract: Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these
models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods
face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce
incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while
prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and
human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that
combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a
scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query
to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from
the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the
model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign
one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves
state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the
strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models.
Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial
effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the
limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future
defense development. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TOSense is a Chrome extension that helps users understand Terms of Service (ToS) by answering questions in natural language, using a crawler and a lightweight LLM pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information asymmetry and legal risks caused by lengthy and obscure ToS agreements.

Method: Combines a crawler (tos-crawl) for content extraction and a lightweight LLM pipeline (MiniLM for retrieval, BART-encoder for verification). Uses a synthetic QA evaluation pipeline (QEP) for training.

Result: Achieves up to 44.5% accuracy on major platforms like Apple, Google, and Netflix.

Conclusion: TOSense effectively simplifies ToS understanding and can be extended to new sites seamlessly.

Abstract: Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of
Service (ToS), leading to information asymmetry and legal risks. This paper
proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about
ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system
combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and
(ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval
and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual
annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP)
that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers
using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple,
Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of
TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters.
During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be
able to experience seamless extraction, interactive question answering, and
instant indexing of new sites.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyGATE is a game-theoretic framework using LLMs and RAG to dynamically prioritize cyber defense mitigations, modeling interactions as a POSG for adaptability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing game-theoretic models for cyber defense are static and lack real-time threat integration, limiting adaptability.

Method: CyGATE models attacker-defender interactions as a POSG, using LLMs with RAG for tactic selection and patch prioritization.

Result: In dynamic patch scheduling, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: CyGATE improves cyber defense by integrating dynamic threat intelligence and strategic foresight, scalable to multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to
dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic
models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely
on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence,
limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic
framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models
(LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection
and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber
conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill
Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the
attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on
evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible
architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated
attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with
multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE
effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability
through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating
attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.

*Alessandro Gaudenzi,Lorenzo Nodari,Lance Kaplan,Alessandra Russo,Murat Sensoy,Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) model for inferring the stage of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) under uncertainty, with robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detection systems lack the ability to account for the progression of APTs, necessitating stage-specific countermeasures.

Method: The authors use EDL to model predictive uncertainty via Dirichlet distribution parameters, enabling stage prediction and OOD input detection.

Result: Experiments show the model accurately infers attack stages with calibrated confidence and detects OOD inputs.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware models like EDL are feasible for staged threat detection in dynamic, adversarial environments.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in
cybersecurity due to their prolonged, multi-stage nature and the sophistication
of their operators. Traditional detection systems typically focus on
identifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without
accounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response
strategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as
countermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early
reconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This
work addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a
focus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a
classification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models
predictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution
over possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most
likely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the
input lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a
simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer
the stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting
OOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics. These results
support the feasibility of deploying uncertainty-aware models for staged threat
detection in dynamic and adversarial environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses security threats in LLMs, focusing on jailbreaking and data leakage. It introduces a methodology for analyzing adversarial interactions and proposes LeakSealer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of LLMs has introduced security risks like jailbreaking and data leakage, necessitating robust detection and defense mechanisms.

Method: The paper presents a methodology for analyzing LLM interaction data and introduces LeakSealer, a framework combining static and dynamic defenses with human oversight.

Result: LeakSealer achieves high precision and recall in detecting prompt injection and PII leakage, outperforming baselines like Llama Guard.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address security vulnerabilities in LLMs, offering practical solutions for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks and data leaks.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to
their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this
increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the
forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses,
has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of
sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a
methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling
the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial
interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking
the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a
model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights
with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique
identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive
defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1)
jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage,
supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static
setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat
dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage
detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines
such as Llama Guard.

Result: Highlights the potential of LS contributions to QIS education, including scalable learning experiences and improved teaching methods for complex domains.

Conclusion: Calls for a two-way partnership between QIS and LS, justifying the effort with theoretical and practical benefits despite disciplinary challenges.

Abstract: As quantum information science advances and the need for pre-college
engagement grows, a critical question remains: How can young learners be
prepared to participate in a field so radically different from what they have
encountered before? This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require
strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field
dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided
environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM
education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to
quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based
research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the
development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The
second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and
participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that
provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way
partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one
that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also
improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly
complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging
these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical
benefits justify the effort.

*J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia,Shibhansh Dohare,Jun Luo,Rich S. Sutton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper compares reinitializing units vs. weights to prevent loss of plasticity in neural networks, proposing selective weight reinitialization as a more effective method in certain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss of plasticity in neural networks during extended training on non-stationary data is a critical issue for continual learning systems.

Method: The paper introduces selective weight reinitialization and compares it to continual backpropagation and ReDo, which reinitialize units. Experiments are conducted in continual supervised learning settings.

Result: Reinitializing weights is more effective in small networks or those with layer normalization, while both methods are equally effective in larger networks without layer normalization.

Conclusion: Selective weight reinitialization maintains plasticity more broadly than reinitializing units, making it a versatile solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its
ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It
is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually.
An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing
parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization
schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new
algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for
reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm
to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that
reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual
supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing
weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units:
(1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network
includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are
equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient
size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing
weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing
units.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF) to improve Transformer-based SNNs by addressing performance gaps caused by binary spike trains. STF enhances spike pattern diversity and outperforms existing methods on static datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based SNNs lag behind ANNs due to binary spike trains. Deep-level feedback loops are costly and inefficient. STF aims to provide a lightweight solution.

Method: STF introduces Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF) as a plug-and-play module for the encoding layer.

Result: STF improves performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, enhances spike diversity, and shows better adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity.

Conclusion: STF is a promising lightweight spike encoding scheme for static scenarios, outperforming direct coding and its variants.

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great
performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced
deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow
this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in
costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy
consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose
Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for
the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding
(TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF
consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN
backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K,
under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF
enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain.
Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity
confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its
potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A new deflation strategy using DeepONet accelerates PCG for large-scale linear systems, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deflation techniques rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov subspaces, which may be inefficient or limited.

Method: Uses DeepONet to generate deflation subspaces via two approaches: approximating near-null space vectors and leveraging DeepONet-predicted solutions. Also introduces sparsity patterns for the deflation operator.

Result: Numerical experiments show effectiveness across various problems, including steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued cases.

Conclusion: The DeepONet-based deflated PCG method generalizes well across model parameters and resolutions, offering improved convergence.

Abstract: We propose a new deflation strategy to accelerate the convergence of the
preconditioned conjugate gradient(PCG) method for solving parametric
large-scale linear systems of equations. Unlike traditional deflation
techniques that rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov
subspaces, we generate the deflation subspaces using operator learning,
specifically the Deep Operator Network~(DeepONet). To this aim, we introduce
two complementary approaches for assembling the deflation operators. The first
approach approximates near-null space vectors of the discrete PDE operator
using the basis functions learned by the DeepONet. The second approach directly
leverages solutions predicted by the DeepONet. To further enhance convergence,
we also propose several strategies for prescribing the sparsity pattern of the
deflation operator. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments encompassing
steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued problems posed on both
structured and unstructured geometries is presented and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed DeepONet-based deflated PCG method, as well as
its generalization across a wide range of model parameters and problem
resolutions.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A U-net model is proposed for 360¬∞ acoustic source localization using spherical semantic segmentation of beamformed audio maps, achieving robust DoA estimates without retraining for different microphone arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL) methods rely on discrete DoA angle regression. This work aims to improve precision and adaptability by segmenting beamformed audio maps into active sound regions.

Method: A modified U-Net processes frequency-domain beamformed audio maps (from a 24-mic array) using Tversky loss to handle class imbalance. Segmentation outputs are post-processed via centroid computation for DoA estimation.

Result: The model generalizes across environments, offering improved angular precision and adaptability to different microphone configurations without retraining.

Conclusion: The U-net-based segmentation approach provides a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding, outperforming traditional SSL methods.

Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization
formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing
discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio
maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using
delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate
signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A
modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps,
learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class
imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed
energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to
different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The
segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated
regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world
open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video
and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show
that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular
precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond
traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).

TL;DR: The paper introduces BART, a solver using syntactic constraints to efficiently narrow down program spaces in synthesis, reducing enumeration time and eliminating up to 99% of unwanted programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in program synthesis is managing the vast program space. Existing methods use constraints for semantics but not to filter unwanted programs. Syntactic constraints offer a way to check and propagate constraints without execution, enabling more efficient synthesis.

Method: The authors leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining feasible and useful solutions. They introduce BART, a solver that propagates and solves these constraints efficiently.

Result: BART eliminates up to 99% of the program space and significantly reduces enumeration time in program synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: Syntactic constraints, implemented via BART, are a powerful tool for efficient program synthesis by drastically reducing the search space and improving performance.

Abstract: A core challenge in program synthesis is taming the large space of possible
programs. Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the
community has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.
Here, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a
potentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic
programming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be
synthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a
constraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In
this work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining
not just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To
demonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates
and solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration
tasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program
space, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time.

*Mikel Vandeloise*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This SLR examines formal foundations of programming paradigms, highlighting limitations in current taxonomies and advocating for a compositional, mathematically grounded approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multi-paradigm languages exposes flaws in traditional classification methods, causing interoperability issues.

Method: A systematic literature review of 74 studies to evaluate classification formalisms and identify primitives for a reconstructive approach.

Result: Existing taxonomies lack granularity and formal unity; compositional reconstruction using Type theory, Category theory, and UTP is promising.

Conclusion: The field is shifting from classification to formal reconstructive frameworks, with a proposed agenda for unification.

Abstract: The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification
methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability
defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of
programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the
art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the
conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,
reconstructive approach.
  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies
lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid
languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a
compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal
set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,
predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming
(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.
  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift
away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive
frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a
research agenda for their unification.

### [288] [Automated Type Annotation in Python Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00422)
*Varun Bharti,Shashwat Jha,Dhruv Kumar,Pankaj Jalote*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: LLMs (like GPT variants) are used to generate Python type annotations via a generate-check-repair pipeline, achieving high consistency (up to 88.6%) and accuracy (up to 79.1%) without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual type annotation in Python is error-prone and time-consuming, while traditional automation methods face limitations like small type vocabularies and reliance on large datasets.

Method: A pipeline where LLMs propose annotations guided by a Concrete Syntax Tree, verified by Mypy, and refined iteratively. Four LLM variants are evaluated on 6000 code snippets.

Result: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini perform best, achieving 70.5% exact-match and 79.1% base-type accuracy, with under one repair iteration on average.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively generate consistent type annotations without fine-tuning, competing with traditional deep learning methods, and the pipeline is extensible to other languages.

Abstract: Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection.
However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires
extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine
learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral
over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we
explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a
generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a
Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies
them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four
LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini
(reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark.
We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which
MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved
consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini,
and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4%
failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and
base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini
perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type
accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results
demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task
specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating
consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep
learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our
work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed
imperative languages like Ruby

### [289] [Constructive Disintegration and Conditional Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00617)
*Natha√´l Da Costa,Marvin Pf√∂rtner,Jon Cockayne*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper critiques the conflation of disintegration with restricted density functions in Bayesian statistics, provides tools for constructing disintegrations, and highlights discrepancies between restricted and disintegration densities. It also examines conditional modes and their practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify misconceptions in constructing disintegrations, a key operation in Bayesian statistics, and to address discrepancies between restricted densities and disintegration densities.

Method: The authors develop mathematical tools for constructing disintegrations and apply these to differentiable manifolds. They also analyze modes of disintegrations and compare them with conditional modes.

Result: The paper demonstrates a simple example where restricted density and disintegration density disagree. It also shows that conditional modes differ from disintegration modes, aligning instead with restricted measures.

Conclusion: The conclusion advocates for the utility of both restricted and disintegration approaches, depending on the modeling context, and highlights practical implications of their discrepancies.

Abstract: Conditioning, the central operation in Bayesian statistics, is formalised by
the notion of disintegration of measures. However, due to the implicit nature
of their definition, constructing disintegrations is often difficult. A
folklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a
disintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the
subset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a
comprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct
disintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on
differentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple
example in which the restricted density and the disintegration density
drastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian
inference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of
disintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a "conditional
mode" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure
obtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted
measure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two
measures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending
on the modelling context.

Motivation: Address scalability challenges in Quantum Support Vector Machines due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations.

Method: Combines class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings and uses 16-qubit tensor network simulation.

Result: Achieves 8.02% accuracy improvement on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, showing ViT embeddings enable quantum advantage while CNN features degrade performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning by leveraging transformer attention and quantum feature spaces.

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to
high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an
embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means
distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding:
ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02%
accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST,
while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network
simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that
quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing
fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces.
This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that
leverages modern neural architectures.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid ML algorithm compresses tag profiles, optimizes feature selection via QAOA, and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) using just five qubits, matching state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum pipelines require too many qubits for sparse semantic tags, making them impractical for NISQ devices. The goal is to reduce qubit usage while maintaining performance.

Method: A three-stage approach: (1) compress tag profiles using SVD sketching and k-means, (2) optimize feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA, and (3) score recommendations with a QsRF built on five qubits.

Result: The method achieves similar performance to full-feature baselines on ICM-150/500 datasets while using only five qubits.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid algorithm effectively reduces qubit requirements for quantum recommenders without sacrificing performance, making it feasible for NISQ devices.

Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags,
yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond
one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close
this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses
tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA,
and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on
just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.
Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($>$97 \%
variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A
100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on
ICM-150/500.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical framework (QMLP) is proposed for efficient structural health monitoring, outperforming classical methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unexpected failures in large-scale civil structures have significant economic and safety impacts, but traditional FE modeling is computationally expensive and complex.

Method: The QMLP uses SPD matrices and polynomial features for quantum processing, combined with classical neural networks for inference.

Result: The QMLP achieves a remarkably low MSE of 0.0000000000316, significantly outperforming classical baselines.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced methods like QMLP offer a scalable, efficient solution for real-time SHM and digital twins.

Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore
platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can
cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element
(FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM),
its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where
low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or
stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum
classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and
facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural
applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to
quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these
features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural
network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical
modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving
computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP
achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely
classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential
of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward
more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose
structural integrity in near real time.

### [293] [Dimension reduction with structure-aware quantum circuits for hybrid machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00048)
*Ammar Daskin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model using Schmidt decomposition and SVD for data compression and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum circuits for exponential data compression and reduce parameters in large-scale models.

Method: Recursive Schmidt decomposition via SVD, quantum circuit ansatz, and hybrid model with a classical neural network.

Result: Quantum circuits successfully compress data, providing effective k-rank approximations for classical processing.

Conclusion: The hybrid model demonstrates potential for efficient large-scale machine learning with reduced parameters.

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular
value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear
combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively
applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector
expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$
principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,
writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of
the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based
denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$
(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the
training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire
datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network
head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the
quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional
probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and
potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training
large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module
for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to
compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the
classical processing component.

### [294] [Riemannian Optimization for Distance Geometry: A Study of Convergence, Robustness, and Incoherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00091)
*Chandler Smith,HanQin Cai,Abiy Tasissa*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Riemannian optimization framework for solving the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, formulated as a low-rank matrix completion task. It guarantees linear convergence under specific sampling conditions and introduces a novel initialization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EDG problem is crucial in applications like sensor network localization and molecular conformation. Existing methods lack guarantees, motivating a robust optimization framework.

Method: A Riemannian optimization approach over positive semi-definite Gram matrices, using non-orthogonal basis encoding and Riemannian gradient descent. Includes a one-step hard thresholding initialization.

Result: Proves linear convergence under Bernoulli sampling with specific probability bounds. Empirical tests show competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for EDG, with theoretical guarantees and practical performance, introducing tailored matrix incoherence for robustness.

Abstract: The problem of recovering a configuration of points from partial pairwise
distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, arises
in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization,
molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a
Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDG problem by formulating it
as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite
Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion
coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix
implicitly enforces geometric consistency through the triangle inequality, a
structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli
sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient
descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with
high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq
\mathcal{O}(\nu^2 r^2 \log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDG-specific incoherence
parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step
hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling
probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu r^{3/2} \log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$.
A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear
operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which
requires a novel application of the Hanson--Wright inequality to establish an
optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms.
Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we
propose a novel notion of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDG setting and
provide robustness guarantees for our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adam-type stochastic methods with neighbor-sampling for GCN training, using control variates to reduce error, and shows optimal convergence rates and superior performance over SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCN training methods lack theoretical guarantees or practical elements like adaptivity and momentum.

Method: Proposes neighbor-sampling-based Adam-type stochastic methods with control variates for nonconvex GCN training.

Result: Achieves optimal convergence rates and outperforms classic NS-based SGD in node classification tasks.

Conclusion: The methods are effective, especially for large-scale graphs, and code is publicly available.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful tool for graph
representation learning. Due to the recursive neighborhood aggregations
employed by GCNs, efficient training methods suffer from a lack of theoretical
guarantees or are missing important practical elements from modern deep
learning algorithms, such as adaptivity and momentum. In this paper, we present
several neighbor-sampling (NS) based Adam-type stochastic methods for solving a
nonconvex GCN training problem. We utilize the control variate technique
proposed by [1] to reduce the stochastic error caused by neighbor sampling.
Under standard assumptions for Adam-type methods, we show that our methods
enjoy the optimal convergence rate. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical
experiments on node classification tasks with several benchmark datasets. The
results demonstrate superior performance of our methods over classic NS-based
SGD that also uses the control-variate technique, especially for large-scale
graph datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/RPI-OPT/CV-ADAM-GNN .

TL;DR: The paper introduces SISDMDP, a structured MDP class, and an efficient policy evaluation method for scalable solutions in large state spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational challenges in MDPs, especially for infinite-horizon settings like average or discounted rewards.

Method: Extends aggregation/disaggregation techniques to MDPs, defining SISDMDP and developing an exact policy evaluation method.

Result: An efficient, scalable solution for policy evaluation in average and discounted reward MDPs.

Conclusion: SISDMDP and the proposed method offer a practical approach to handling large-scale MDPs.

Abstract: Solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains a central challenge in
sequential decision-making, especially when dealing with large state spaces and
long-term optimization criteria. A key step in Bellman dynamic programming
algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in
infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward
formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation
techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting
structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a
structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable
Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input
decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy
induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into
interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and
efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a
scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.
